The Glulx Runtime Instrumentation Project (GRIP) provides debugging tools for authors of interactive fiction (IF) by building on the capabilities of the Glulx virtual machine.

GRIP is hosted on SourceForge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/.

This is a beta (re-)rerelease.  A few extensions are still in need of some cleanup and documentation, but otherwise everything is ready to use.

Unlike the original beta release, the documentation now reflects the latest version of Inform's Windows IDE, and there is a JAR that simplifies the process of setting up symbolic links and including the extensions.  Incidentally, it also picks up a handful of bug fixes.
