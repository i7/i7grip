[For each of the kinds defined by Context-Free Parsing Engine you will see a sentence like

	A parseme is an invalid parseme.

This bewildering statement actually sets up parsemes as a qualitative value with default value the parseme at address one, which, as we say, is invalid.  (We could have gone with a quantitative kind for default zero, but then we would open up the possibility for arithmetic on the pointers.)  I wish it weren't necessary, but at least in this build Inform doesn't let us provide a default value any other way, and, moreover, we need a default value or else only I6 substitutions are allowed to decide on parsemes.]

[The convenience phrases can build some lengthy expressions.]
Use MAX_EXPRESSION_NODES of 4096.

Chapter "Use Options"

Book "Runtime Checks"

Chapter "Messages" - unindexed

To fail at adding parsemes to a parser already in normal form:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I tried to add parsemes to a parser, but it had been already put in normal form, which ought not happen until all parsemes and productions have been added.[terminating the story]".

To fail at adding productions to a parser already in normal form:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I tried to add productions to a parser, but it had been already put in normal form, which ought not happen until all parsemes and productions have been added.[terminating the story]".

To fail at putting a parser into normal form twice:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I tried to put a parser into normal form, but that had already been done, suggesting a bug.[terminating the story]".

To fail at normalizing an absurd grammar:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context-Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I was given a grammar in which the empty text could be understood as a particular parseme, as could several copies of the parseme itself.  This is a problematic edge case that I don't handle, mostly to keep things simple, but also because it is almost always a bug.[terminating the story]".

To fail at initializing a parser that is not in normal form:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I tried parse with a parser that hadn't yet been put in normal form.[terminating the story]".

To fail at initializing a parser with a foreign parseme:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context-Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I was asked to parse for a parseme in a parser where it doesn't belong.[terminating the story]".

To fail at reinitializing a parser mid-parse:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I tried to reinitialize a parser mid-parse, which should never happen.[terminating the story]".

To fail at locating a doppelganger parse tree vertex:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context-Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I cloned a parse tree and then went to find the doppelganger of a vertex from the original tree.  But there was no such vertex, which means that the clone must have failed in a way that is only possible if the original tree's internal state has been corrupted.[terminating the story]".

To fail at making a mismatched unsubstitution:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context-Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I was rewriting a parse tree after finding a match, but my list of rewrites contained a nonsense instruction to replace one vertex with two unrelated ones.  Either the tree or the list must have been corrupted.[terminating the story]".

To fail at unrotating from a nonrotation parseme:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I was rewriting a parse tree after finding a match, but my list of rewrites contained a instruction that led me to try rotating a wrongly shaped or out-of-bounds region.  Either the tree or the list must have been corrupted.[terminating the story]".

To fail at expanding an already expanded parse tree vertex:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I tried to expand a vertex in one of the candidate parse trees, but the vertex was already expanded, a sure sign that I'm confused.[terminating the story]".

To fail at rewriting trivial recursion:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I found a production that understand a parseme as itself, even after the code to prune such productions.  Either my data structures have been tampered with or I am confused.[terminating the story]".

To fail at finding a parse step in a consistent state:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Context Free Parsing Engine[with explanation]I found a parse step that gave me a sequence of expansions to use for a production, but that sequence didn't match the production's length.  I must have created that parse step wrongly, or else it has been corrupted.[terminating the story]".

Part "Grammar Structures"

Chapter "Parsemes"

[``Parseme'' (pronounced like ``lexeme'') is another, rarer term for a symbol (i.e., a terminal or a nonterminal) in a BNF grammar.  It seemed like something unlikely to cause name clashes.]

Section "The Parseme Kind"

A parseme is a kind of value.
A parseme is an invalid parseme.  [See the note in the book "Extension Information."]
The specification of a parseme is "Parsemes are Context-Free Parsing Engine's analog to understand tokens.  Some match literal input (these are called terminals), while others match sequences of other parsemes (nonterminals).  Unlike Inform understand tokens, parsemes can be recursive: it is possible for '[parseme A][parseme B]' to be understood as '[parseme A]', for instance."

[Layout:
	4 bytes for the human-friendly name
	4 bytes for the owning context-free parser
	4 bytes for the parsing phrase
	4 bytes for the production linked list
	4 bytes for the original parseme (null if none)
	4 bytes for the parse attempt linked list
	4 bytes for the parse step linked list]
[Some parsemes are split into two during grammar normalization.  One has roughly the same meaning as the original, and the other converts left recursion into right recursion (a ``rotation parseme'').  The original parseme field is set in the latter so that we can replace it with the former when we recover the parse tree.]
[The parse attempt linked list contains every beginning index at which we have tried to match this parseme.]
[The parse step linked list maps beginning indices to zero or more parse steps, each of which matches this parseme at that beginning index.]

Chapter "Parse Tree Vertices"

Section "The Parse Tree Vertex Kind"

A parse tree vertex is a kind of value.  The plural of parse tree vertex is parse tree vertices.
A parse tree vertex is an invalid parse tree vertex.  [See the note in the book "Extension Information."]
The specification of a parse tree vertex is "A parse tree vertex represents all of the input matched by a single occurrence of a parseme.  For instance, if a parseme X matches two occurrences of the parseme Y, and the parseme Y matches the literal text 'z', a parse of the text 'zz' would have three parse tree vertices: one for each time Y matched a 'z' and another for X matching the whole input.  We think of these vertices as organized in a family tree where children vertices constitute their parents, and when we describe adjacent siblings, we say that the vertex that matched earlier input is on the left.  Thus, Y has two vertices, one on the left and one on the right, and their parent is X's vertex."

			otherwise:

Context-Free Parsing Engine ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: Synopsis

Context-Free Parsing Engine mimics Inform's parsing capabilities, but as a
separate set of phrases that can applied to any input, even nontextual input.
Furthermore, parsemes in Context-Free Parsing Engine, which are the analog to
understand tokens, may be recursive.  For instance, it is possible to write the
equivalent of

	Understand "tell [an NPC] to [an imperative command]" as "[an imperative command]".

and then parse something like

	"tell Jemison to tell Watson to kill Zoe"

On the other hand, Context-Free Parsing Engine is slower and has no built-in
facilities for disambiguating or handling malformed input.

Details are in the following chapters.

Chapter: Usage

Section: A note

When our intent is to parse (possibly punctuated) words, we should use the
extension Punctuated Word Parsing Engine, which builds on this extension and
provides phrases that mimic Inform's understand-as syntax.

Section: Background

In interactive fiction, the term "parsing" usually means the end-to-end process
of converting a player's command into an action to take in the simulated world.
"Parsing" in the extension Context-Free Parsing Engine, however, should be
understood as it is in general computer science: a single step in that larger
procedure.  Once an input has been converted to a sequence of chunks, called
"lexemes", for instance,

	"tell", "Jemison", "to", "tell", "Watson", "to", "kill", "Zoe"

the parsing operation organizes the lexemes in an outline-like structure, which
we refer to as a "parse tree".  For example,

	1. "[an imperative command]"
	1.a. "tell"
	1.b. "[an NPC]"
	1.b.1. "Jemison"
	1.c. "to"
	1.d. "[an imperative command]"
	1.d.1. "tell"
	1.d.2. "[an NPC]"
	1.d.2.a. "Watson"
	1.d.3. "to"
	1.d.4. "[an imperative command]"
	1.d.4.a. "kill"
	1.d.4.b. "[an NPC]"
	1.d.4.b.1. "Zoe"

Here, item 1 tells us that the whole thing is an imperative command.  Parts
1a--1d give its structure: the command is to tell an NPC to do something.  Item
1b1 indicates that the NPC is Jemison, items 1d1--1d4 elaborate on what the
player is asking Jemison to do, and so on.

In computer science lingo, 1, 1a, 1b, etc. are called "parse tree vertices" and
their annotations, like "[an imperative command]", "tell", and "[an NPC]", are
called "parsemes" (pronounced like extreme, or supreme, or lexeme, with an -eem
sound at the end).  Parsemes are very similar to Inform's understand tokens, and
like understand tokens, the same parseme can appear in several parse tree
vertices.

Parsemes come in two flavors.  Those that correspond to lexemes in the input,
such as "tell", are called "terminals" because they end the process of
subdividing the input: an entry with a terminal cannot have any subentries.  The
others, written in bracket notation, stand for a general concept that might
manifest as several different lexeme sequences.  "[an NPC]", for instance, can
on closer inspection turn out to be "Jemison", "Watson", or "Zoe".  As one might
expect, the term for these parsemes is "nonterminals".

While the terminals that appear in a parse tree are governed by the input, the
choice and arrangement of nonterminals must be controlled some other way, by
rules termed "productions" (so called because an entry in a parse tree is said
to "produce" its subentries).  Productions are much like Inform's understand
lines.  In the example above we would have five of them, two for imperative
commands:

	Understand "tell [an NPC] to [an imperative command]" as "[an imperative command]".

and

	Understand "kill [an NPC]" as "[an imperative command]".

as well as three for NPCs:

	Understand "Jemison" as "[an NPC]".

	Understand "Watson" as "[an NPC]".

and

	Understand "Zoe" as "[an NPC]".

A collection of lexemes, parsemes, and productions is called a grammar.  Given a
grammar, an input, and a target parseme, a parser's job is to find all parse
trees that match the input and have the target parseme at the top.

We say "all" because the productions might not be strict enough for every input
to produce a unique parse tree.  We call such lax grammars "ambiguous".  To
illustrate, suppose that there is a production meaning

	Understand "[a noun] of [a noun]" as "[a noun]".

and we want to parse

	"a box of troubles of the worst kind"

as a noun.  We could either end up with

	1. "[a noun]"
	1.a. "[a noun]"
	1.a.1. "[a noun]"
	1.a.1.a. "a box"
	1.a.2. "of"
	1.a.3. "[a noun]"
	1.a.3.a. "troubles"
	1.b. "of"
	1.c. "[a noun]"
	1.c.1. "the worst kind"

which is to say that the box of troubles is of the worst kind or

	1. "[a noun]"
	1.a. "[a noun]"
	1.a.1. "a box"
	1.b. "of"
	1.c. "[a noun]"
	1.c.1. "[a noun]"
	1.c.1.a. "troubles"
	1.c.2. "of"
	1.c.3. "[a noun]"
	1.c.3.a. "the worst kind"

in which the box contains the worst kind of troubles.  Whether the distinction
matters depends on our application.

When it does, one possible solution is to generate both trees but then discard
one at some later stage of processing, like inside a routine that asks
disambiguation questions.  Such a strategy works with Inform's built-in parser
because it limits the amount of ambiguity we can introduce in a grammar.  But
when we allow recursion, that tack doesn't always pan out.  A grammar can be so
ambiguous that some inputs have infinitely many parse trees.

So sometimes we must manually make the grammar unambiguous, or at least less
ambiguous.  In this case, we could add another parseme and rewrite the
production to break its symmetry:

	Understand "[a noun] of [a noun or an of-phrase]" as "[a noun or an of-phrase]".

There is one kind of ambiguity so troublesome that even Context-Free Parsing
Engine won't let it through: a production where a parseme matches multiple
copies of itself (but nothing else):

	Understand "[an absurdity][an absurdity]" as "[an absurdity]".

in combination with a production where that same parseme matches nothing at all:

	Understand "" as "[an absurdity]".

The problem is that this grammar makes a parseme match no input infinitely many
ways, and the parser cannot safely throw away either of the productions.  (If
the first production had understood only a single occurrence of the parseme as
itself, the extension would also have been in trouble, but it would have
automatically recovered by ignoring the recursive production.)  Fortunately,
it's hard to imagine a situation where this arrangement would be useful.

Section: Creating a parser

Context-Free Parsing Engine provides the kind

	a context-free parser

for storing parsers.  Variables of this kind initially have the value

	an invalid context-free parser

which, as one might expect, cannot legally be an argument to any of the parsing
phrases.  To obtain a useful value, we request

	a new context-free parser

as in

	now the auxiliary parser is a new context-free parser;

At the moment context-free parsers can be created but not destroyed.  This may
change in a future version of the extension.

Section: Creating parsemes

Once we have a parser, we need to equip it with parsemes.  Parsemes are usually
stored in values that vary, for instance,

	An imperative command is a parseme that varies.

The naming here is a little awkward, but makes more sense when we use
substitution syntax, as extensions like Punctuated Word Parsing Engine let us
do:

	understand "tell [an NPC] to [an imperative command]" as "[an imperative command]";

Parseme variables will initially hold

	an invalid parseme

which, like an invalid context-free parser, is not a value to be given to
parsing phrases.  We replace it by writing

	now (X - a temporary named parseme) is a new nonterminal in (A - a context-free parser) named (T - some text)

for nonterminals and

	now (X - a parseme variable) is a new terminal in (A - a context-free parser) named (T - some text) and parsed by (P - a phrase parse tree vertex -> nothing)

for terminals.  The names have no significance except to make debugging easier,
although we can look them up and print them if we wish.  We will wait to discuss
parsing phrases until the section "Terminals' parsing phrases".

It is important that we keep track of what each parseme means, because parsemes
are only able to answer a few questions about themselves:

	the owner of (A - a parseme)

decides on the context-free parser that owns A,

	if (A - a parseme) is a terminal:
		....

checks whether A is a terminal, with the opposite condition evaluated by

	if (A - a parseme) is a nonterminal:
		....

and the phrase

	the human-friendly name of (A - a parseme)

retrieves the name that we originally gave as T.

Section: Creating productions

Production variables, like parsers and parsemes, begin by holding an invalid
value,

	an invalid production

but we can ask for new, useful values:

	a new production for (S - a parseme)

Here S is the parseme that we would like to understand a parseme sequence as.
That sequence is initially empty, but we can add parsemes to it, either on the
left:

	prepend (S - a parseme) to (A - a production)

or the right:

	append (S - a parseme) to (A - a production)

For instance,

	let telling be a new production for an imperative command;
	prepend the word to to telling;
	prepend an NPC to telling;
	append an imperative command to telling;
	prepend the word tell to telling;

would be one way to build up an equivalent to

	understand "tell [an NPC] to [an imperative command]" as "[an imperative command]";

Productions, like parsemes, cannot tell us much about themselves.  In fact,
apart from the debugging facilities at the end of this chapter, the only query
we can make to a production is a request for

	the owner of (A - a production)

which returns the context-free parser that owns it.  Usually we forget about
productions as soon as we've filled them in.

Section: Putting a parser in normal form

Once we have all of the parsemes and productions established, we invoke the
phrase

	put (A - a context-free parser) into normal form

The parser will then optimize its grammar for left-to-right parsing.  At this
point the grammar is set in stone: we cannot add more parsemes, we cannot add
more productions, and we cannot even put A into normal form again.  But A is now
able to parse, whereas before it was not.  In case we need to check what
operations are possible, the extension provides the conditional

	if (A - a context-free parser) is in normal form:
		....

Section: Loading input

To begin the actual parsing process, we give a parser some input:

	write the content (X - a value) and the lexeme count (N - a number) to (A - a context-free parser)

Here X is the actual input.  It can be of any kind, but to avoid mysterious bugs
we should make sure that it's of a kind that the terminals are prepared to
handle.

N, in turn, is the number of lexemes in X.  While the terminals' parsing phrases
might be able to figure out N from X, the parser cannot, and it needs to know
when to stop parsing.

Section: Parsing

Once a parser is in normal form and has input, we can iterate over the parse
trees for that input.  The loop

	repeat with (I - a nonexisting parse tree vertex variable) running through matches for (S - a parseme):
		....

runs once for each tree (unless we use "break"), setting I to be the parse tree
vertex at the top.  These trees and their vertices become invalid when a loop
iteration completes---if we want to keep a copy, it is not enough to assign I to
a variable.  Instead, we must clone the tree, as in

	let the clone be the parse tree vertex corresponding to I in a new clone of its tree;

The new variable the clone is completely equivalent to I, except that it will
survive until we delete it with the phrase

	delete (V - a parse tree vertex) and its descendants

as in

	delete the clone and its descendants;

It is a bad idea to let clones accumulate in memory unnecessarily, so we should
be sure to delete them as soon as they are no longer needed.  But be careful; it
is a worse idea to delete only part of a tree.  If we have a vertex that is not
topmost in its tree, we should not give it to the deletion phrase.

One final warning: if we break out of a loop over parse trees by a mechanism
other than "break", like "stop" or "decide on", the loop won't have a chance to
clean up the current iteration's tree, so we must do so manually.  For instance:

	repeat with the root running through matches for ...:
		if ...:
			delete the root and its descendants;
			decide yes.

Section: Inspecting parse trees

Parse tree vertices have comparatively much to tell us.  As before we can ask for

	the owner of (A - a parse tree vertex)

to discover the parser that owns them.  We can also ask for

	the parseme of (A - a parse tree vertex)

to get their annotation, and

	the production of (A - a parse tree vertex)

if that parseme is a nonterminal, to obtain the production that justifies that
annotation.

As for relating parse tree vertices to the input, the phrase

	the beginning lexeme index of (A - a parse tree vertex)

will tell us which lexeme is the first one A matches and

	the end lexeme index of (A - a parse tree vertex)

will tell us the first following lexeme that it does not match.  These indices
are counted from zero.  For example, with the input

	"tell Jemison to tell Watson to kill Zoe"

broken into word lexemes, the imperative command that matched "kill Zoe" would
have a beginning lexeme index of six (there are six words before the word
"kill"), and an end lexeme index of eight (adding on the two matched words
brings that count to eight).

Parse tree vertices also know about their neighbors in the parse tree.  Consider
A to be parse tree vertex 1d4 in

	1. "[an imperative command]"
	1.a. "tell"
	1.b. "[an NPC]"
	1.b.1. "Jemison"
	1.c. "to"
	1.d. "[an imperative command]"
	1.d.1. "tell"
	1.d.2. "[an NPC]"
	1.d.2.a. "Watson"
	1.d.3. "to"
	1.d.4. "[an imperative command]" (this is A)
	1.d.4.a. "kill"
	1.d.4.b. "[an NPC]"
	1.d.4.b.1. "Zoe"

By writing

	the parse tree vertex to visit after (A - a parse tree vertex)

we obtain the next vertex in outline order, 1d4a in this case.

The phrase

	the parent of (A - a parse tree vertex)

would decide on vertex 1d (the vertex immediately above),

	the first child of (A - a parse tree vertex)

would result in 1d4a, and

	the last child of (A - a parse tree vertex)

would be 1d4b.

Asking for

	the left sibling of (A - a parse tree vertex)

would produce vertex 1d3 (the preceding vertex at the same level), whereas

	the right sibling of (A - a parse tree vertex)

ought not decide on a vertex at all---1d4 has no such sibling.  In fact,
whenever we ask for a relation that does not exist, all of these phrases will
return

	a null parse tree vertex

Like

	an invalid parse tree vertex

which is the initial value of parse tree vertex variables, null vertices cannot
be meaningfully passed to phrases.  But we can check for them by applying the
adjective "null":

	if (V - a parse tree vertex) is null:
		....

In addition, because the vertex at the top of a tree is traditionally called the
"root", the tests

	if (A - a parse tree vertex) is a root:
		....

and

	if (A - a parse tree vertex) is not a root:
		....

are provided as shorthand forms for

	if the parent of (A - a parse tree vertex) is null:
		....

and

	if the parent of (A - a parse tree vertex) is not null:
		....

respectively.  Likewise, the phrase

	the root of (A - a parse tree vertex)

obtains the root of the tree that A inhabits.  In the case of vertex 1d4, this
would be vertex 1.

The extension also includes convenience phrases for iterating over vertices'
relatives.  The loop

	repeat with (I - a nonexisting parse tree vertex variable) running through the children of (A - a parse tree vertex):
		....

sets I to each child of A, starting with the left-most (earliest) child.  With
vertex 1d4, the first iteration would have I being vertex 1d4a, while the second
would store 1d4b.  Another,

	repeat with (I - a nonexisting parse tree vertex variable) running through the right siblings of (A - a parse tree vertex):
		....

sets I to the right sibling of A, then to the right sibling of that vertex, and
so on.  It would do nothing when A is vertex 1d4 because 1d4 has no right siblings.

The utility of these loops can be seen in their search variations.  On one hand
we have

	the first match for (S - a parseme) among the children of (V - a parse tree vertex)

which decides on the left-most vertex that is both a child of V and annotated
with the parseme S.  If it cannot find any such vertex, it decides on a null
one.  The similar

	the next match for (S - a parseme) after the child (V - a parse tree vertex)

starts from one such match and finds the next one.  Again, if there are no
suitable vertices, the phrase produces a null vertex as its result.

Finally, to top off all of these searching phrases, we have the simple
conditional

	if (S - a parseme) appears among the children of (V - a parse tree vertex):
		....

The code represented by the ellipses executes if any direct child of V has the
parseme S.

Section: Processing parsed input

In many applications we want to process vertices annotated with different
parsemes differently.  The straightforward approach is to write a series of ifs:

	To decide what stored action is represented by the tree rooted at (V - a parse tree vertex):
		if the parseme of V is an imperative command:
			...
		otherwise if the parseme of V is an interrogative command:
			...
		otherwise ....

Unfortunately, this lumps all of the cases together in one phrase, and it
becomes awkward to add or replace cases from another part of the source text.
So instead, Context-Free Parsing Engine defines the relation

	the having a parseme relation

which relates vertices to the parseme that annotate them, as well as the verb
``to have the parseme''.  We then write

	To decide what stored action is represented by the tree rooted at (V - a parse tree vertex that has the parseme an imperative command):
		....

	To decide what stored action is represented by the tree rooted at (V - a parse tree vertex that has the parseme an interrogative command):
		....

which places every case in its own phrase.

Section: Terminals' parsing phrases

When dealing with nonterminals and productions, a parser can ignore the kind of
its input.  But to match input against terminals it needs some assistance, which
is provided in the form of parsing phrases.  Each terminal is equipped with one
parsing phrase, which receives that terminal and a beginning lexeme index and
determines whether the lexemes at that index match.

Let us begin with an example:

	To parse for (S - a parseme) beginning at lexeme index (I - a number) by matching a single lexeme (this is an example parsing phrase):
		....

Using

	the owner of (A - a parseme)

combined with the phrase

	the (K - a kind) content of (A - a context-free parser)

we first access the input being parsed.  For the example our input will be a
list of lexemes:

	let the lexeme list be the list of lexemes content of the owner of S;

Next, we convert the lexeme index, which counts from zero, to a list index,
which Inform has count from one:

	let the list index be I plus one;

Because our example phrase will never match zero lexemes, we want to stop any
matching attempts when the index is out of bounds.  One way is to write

	if the list index is greater than the number of entries in the lexeme list:
		stop;

another is to use the phrase

	the lexeme count of (A - a context-free parser)

and write

	if the list index is greater than the lexeme count of the owner of V;
		stop;

On the other hand, if there is a lexeme to match, we should retrieve it:

	let the lexeme be entry list index of the lexeme list;

We then compare the lexeme against the parseme:

	if the lexeme is ...:

Should the comparison succeed, we need to notify the parser of the extent of our
match.  First we compute the end index, based on the fact that we have matched
one lexeme:

	let the end lexeme index be I plus one;

and then we report the match, using the phrase

	match (S - a parseme) from lexeme index (B - a number) to lexeme index (E - a number)

which is only valid inside of a parsing phrase, and only if S is the parseme we
were given, B is the beginning index that we called I, and E is an in-bounds
number greater than or equal to B.  In our case, we write

	match S from lexeme index I to lexeme index the end lexeme index.

Put together, the code looks like this:

	To parse for (S - a parseme) beginning at lexeme index (I - a number) by matching a single lexeme (this is an example parsing phrase):
		let the lexeme list be the list of lexemes content of the owner of S;
		let the list index be I plus one;
		if the list index is greater than the number of entries in the lexeme list:
			stop;
		let the lexeme be entry list index of the lexeme list;
		if the lexeme is ...:
			let the end lexeme index be I plus one;
			match S from lexeme index I to lexeme index the end lexeme index.

There is a possibility, which we did not encounter in this example, that there
are several end indices that we could sensibly choose.  For instance, suppose
that we want a terminal to match any alliteration.  At lexeme index zero of
"marvelous marble march of stairs" we can match both "marvelous marble" and
"marvelous marble march", so we should invoke the phrase

	match (S - a parseme) from lexeme index (B - a number) to lexeme index (E - a number)

twice---once with E set to two and another time with E being three.

Section: Debugging phrases

During development it is sometimes handy to see the internal representation of
the parsing structures.  The primary phrase for inspecting a parser is

	say (A - a context-free parser)

which renders the (possibly optimized) productions of A in a standard notation,
BNF, and lists the parse tree rewrites used to undo the effects of grammar
optimization.  For less overwhelming output, we can inspect individual parsemes
and productions via

	say (A - a parseme)

and

	say (A - a production)

not to mention

	say the productions of (A - a parseme)

We may also print a vertex through the say phrase

	say (A - a parse tree vertex)

As for reading the output, parsemes are identified by a unique code and their
human-friendly name, and will usually print as something like this:

	(parseme 0x1234ABCD: an NPC)

If they are in a vertex that has matched lexemes, the beginning and end indices
of those lexemes follow in bracket notation, as in

	(parseme 0x1234ABCD: an NPC) (7..9)

and if there are more parsemes that made the matching possible, they will appear
in curly braces after that:

	(parseme 0x1234ABCD: an NPC) (7..9) { (parseme 0x5678EF01) ... }

An epsilon is used to indicate an empty list of parsemes.

Chapter: Requirements, Limitations, and Bugs

This version was tested with Inform 6G60.  It will probably function on newer
versions, and it may function under slightly older versions, though there is no
guarantee.

Section: Regarding bugs

If you encounter a bug, check first on the project website
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/) to see whether a newer version of
this extension is available.  If, even using the latest version, the fault
remains, please file a bug report: On the website, choose "Support" from the
toolbar and follow the link in the box titled "Best Way to Get Help".

I will try to respond quickly, at least with an estimate of when the bug might
be fixed, though sometimes I am away from the internet for a week or two at a
time.
