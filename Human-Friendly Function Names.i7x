Book "Rewriting States" - unindexed

A function name rewrite state is a kind of value.
The function name rewrite states are transitioning to gobble whitespace, transitioning after function name whitespace, and transitioning after a function name symbol.
The specification of a function name rewrite state is "Function name rewrite states are used inside Human-Friendly Function Names to represent the various states that its function name canonicalizer, specifically the part dealing with punctuation and whitespace, can be in.  Transitioning to gobble whitespace means that whitespace is being removed completely, transitioning after function name whitespace means that one or more whitespace characters in the middle of a function name are being collapsed into a single space, and transitioning after a function name symbol means that no whitespace transformations are ongoing."

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: Synopsis

Human-Friendly Function Names allows debugging extensions to print rules,
phrases, and other functions in a form that the author is likely to understand,
such as "instead of jumping", "the start in the correct scenes rule",
"doubling", or the "the I6 routine ScopeCeiling", even when the debugging tool
doesn't know the kind of the function.  The extension also makes it possible to
parse these names.

Details are in the following chapters.

Chapter: Usage

Section: Introduction

By the time a story has been compiled for the Glulx virtual machine, every bit
of source text capable of changing the world at runtime has been stashed away in
one or more Glulx functions.  These functions correspond almost exactly to
Inform 6 routines, some of which come from I7 rules or I7 phrases.  For each
function and each way of thinking about a function, Human-Friendly Function
Names tracks a set of names.  For instance, the function that implements this
rule:

	Instead of waving hands: say "You wave hello."

would be called by one name,

	"instead of waving hands"

when we think about it as a rule, but perhaps

	"the I6 routine R_2748"

when we regard it as an I6 routine.  It would have no known names if we treated
it as a phrase, since it isn't one.

There are some complications, first of all because rules and phrases might
compile to two I6 routines instead of one.  For example, the rule

	Instead of singing: let a temporary value be some indexed text.

will normally be converted to an outer routine---"R_2750" perhaps---that
reserves memory for the indexed text, invokes an inner routine with a name like
"R_SHELL_0", and then frees the memory up again.  Here we call the outer routine
a "routine shell" and the inner one a "routine kernel" (though this is a little
confusing because the kernel has the word "SHELL" in its name).  The shell is
named normally, that is

	"instead of singing"

as a rule and

	"the I6 routine R_2750"

as an I6 routine, while the kernel is named based on the shell:

	"the kernel of 'instead of singing'"

and

	"the I6 routine R_SHELL_0"

Another complication is that certain I6 routines can be overridden, so that,
despite having the same name, they no may longer do what an I6 programmer would
expect.  These are the veneer routines documented in the Inform technical
manual:

	"The 'veneer' is a thin section of code generated by Inform as an
	intermediate layer between the code compiled from the source, and the
	[virtual machine] itself: like the veneer on a table, it gilds the
	surface of the [virtual machine], or so the term is supposed to mean."

Human-Friendly Function Names treats veneer routines specially, calling them out
as such and indicating whether or not they are overridden.  To illustrate,
CA__Pr might be named

	"the overridden I6 veneer routine CA__Pr (calling a property value)"

Note also the parenthetical annotation, which is included because the internal
names for veneer routines can be fairly cryptic to the uninitiated.

Section: The contents of the database

We should mention up front that Human-Friendly Function Names only goes so far
in populating its database.  Rule names, for instance, are entered
automatically, as are phrase names given by "this is".  But the presence of
other function information depends on whether we include code capable of finding
it and storing it in the database.  There are currently three examples of such
code:

The extension I6 Routine Names is little more than a table of commonly appearing
I6 routines, including all of the veneer routines.  When it detects the presence
of Human-Friendly Function Names, it stores its information in the database.

The Glulx Runtime Instrumentation Framework includes I6 Routine Names and also
notes any routine shell/kernel pairs that it comes across during
instrumentation.

Debug File Parsing requires a bit of setup and slows down the story when it
loads its data, but it can name every statically compiled function in a story,
which for most stories is all of them.  It can also detect routine shell/kernel
pairs on its own, or, when the Glulx Runtime Instrumentation Framework is also
included, using a more robust hybrid algorithm.

Section: Looking up a name (and related information) by function address

To obtain a function name, we request

	the human-friendly name for the function at address (A - a number)

where A is the memory address of the function.  This phrase will decide on the
name most likely to make sense to an I7 programmer: a rule name if one is
available, a phrase name if not, a routine kernel name if neither exists, an I6
routine name after that, and, if all else fails, the text "an unnamed rule or
phrase".  Ties between names in the same category are broken by choosing the
name that was given last.

We can also ask whether a function is a veneer routine:

	if the function at address (A - a number) is a veneer routine:
		....

or specifically an overridden veneer routine:

	if the function at address (A - a number) is an overridden veneer routine:
		....

on non-overridden veneer routine:

	if the function at address (A - a number) is a default veneer routine:
		....

If the function is a veneer routine, the phrase

	the annotation for the function at address (A - a number)

will decide on some text that describes the routine's purpose in English.

Section: Looking up a function address by name

Similarly, given a name, we can request a set of function addresses:

	the list of addresses matching the function name (T - some text)

(Note that the phrase takes text, not indexed text.  If we need to compute the
name at runtime, we must use synthetic text from the extension Low-Level Text.)

The result is a new linked list (which we are responsible for deleting) (see the
extension Low-Level Linked Lists) where each linked list vertex's key is the
address of a function having that name.  It is not necessary for the name to be
formatted exactly, nor for it to be the preferred name for a function.  For
instance, the rule

	Before going through a closed door (called the blocking door):
		....

could be identified with

	"Before going through a closed door (called the blocking door)"

or

	"before going through a closed door"

or even

	"  beFoRe gOInG   tHRoUGH    a   cLoSEd dOoR(   BlOCkInG dOOr )   "

(In the HTML format that Inform generates the whitespace issues in the last
example might not be visible.)

Section: Routine shells and kernels

Having the address of a function that might be a kernel, we can ask for

	the routine shell address of the function at address (A - a number)

If the function is in fact a kernel and the database knows its shell, this
phrase will return the shell's function address.  Otherwise it will return zero.

Likewise, with the address of a possible shell

	the routine kernel address of the function at address (A - a number)

is the function address of its kernel, if a kernel is known to exist, and zero
otherwise.  Authors using either the Glulx Runtime Instrumentation Framework
(GRIF) or Debug File Parsing (or both) can write the phrase

	guess the routine kernel for (A - a sayable value)

with A being a function address to guarantee that, if a kernel of A exists, it
will be known.  The similar phrase

	guess the routine shell for (A - a sayable value)

should guarantee that a request for a routine shell will return one if one
exists.  It is only provided by Debug File Parsing, but becomes more robust when
GRIF is available.

Section: Updating human-friendly function names

If we would like to add function names of our own to the database, we must write
a function-naming rule.  For example:

	A function-naming rule (this is the name quux rule):
		....

The function-naming rulebook is traversed exactly once, whenever the first
database query is made.  (If the Glulx Runtime Instrumentation Framework is
included, the first query might be made in a instrumentation context, where
certain normal Inform operations are unsafe.  See that extension's
documentation.)

Within a function-naming rule we have four phrases available that should not
otherwise be used.  The first,

	give the rule at address (A - a number) the rule name (T - some text)

treats A as the address of a rule and assigns a new name.  Such names should
usually end with the word "rule", as in "the block thinking rule".

The second is similar:

	give the phrase function at address (A - a number) the phrase name (T - some text)

The only thing to note here is that A is the address of the function
implementing the phrase, which is different from the address of the phrase data
structure.  The extra word "function" is included as a reminder.

Third,

	give the veneer routine at address (A - a number) the override flag (F - a truth state) and the routine name (T - some text) and the annotation (Z - some text)

In addition to the function address and a name in a certain category, veneer
routines are expected to be marked as overridden or not, hence F, and to have an
explanation of what they do, Z.  Normally all of this data is taken from I6
Routine Names, and we do not have to worry about it.

The final one,

	give the routine at address (A - a number) the routine name (T - some text)

acts much like the other three, but applies to routines that don't fit in any of
the above categories.

Section: Updating routine shells and kernels 

Just as we can associate names with functions, we can also manually associate
routine shells and routine kernels.  The relevant phrase is

	associate the routine shell at address (A - a number) with the routine kernel at address (B - a number)

It can be invoked at any time, not just when the function-naming rules are
running.

Section: Some words of caution

Most text stored by Human-Friendly Function Names is synthetic (see the
extension Low-Level Text).  As a consequence, a test like

	if the human-friendly name for the function at address 72 is "the I6 routine ShowExtensionVersions":
		....

might always be false, even if the I6 routine ShowExtensionVersions is located
at address 72: the two texts will hold the same sequence of characters, but be
located separately in memory, and Inform's "is" will therefore consider them to
be different.  Instead of comparing function names with "is", we should write
the condition with "is identical to":

	if the human-friendly name for the function at address 72 is identical to "the I6 routine ShowExtensionVersions":
		....

Chapter: Requirements, Limitations, and Bugs

This version was tested with Inform 6G60.  It will probably function on newer
versions, and it may function under slightly older versions, though there is no
guarantee.

Section: Regarding bugs

If you encounter a bug, check first on the project website
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/) to see whether a newer version of
this extension is available.  If, even using the latest version, the fault
remains, please file a bug report: On the website, choose "Support" from the
toolbar and follow the link in the box titled "Best Way to Get Help".

I will try to respond quickly, at least with an estimate of when the bug might
be fixed, though sometimes I am away from the internet for a week or two at a
time.
