Verbose Diagnostics Lite ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: Synopsis

Verbose Diagnostics Lite is a less powerful version of Verbose Diagnostics that
gets by without debug information---if we include it, runtime problems will be
reported with a call stack, as in

	*** Run-time problem P1: Tried to move the chorus (a backdrop) to the stage, which is not a region.
	within instead of singing (at address 89493),
	within the instead stage rule (at address 88166),
	within the generate action rule (at address 70026),
	within the main story routine (at address 69439).

but these call stacks will not always be able to use human-friendly names.

Details are in the following chapters.

Chapter: Usage

When Verbose Diagnostics Lite is included, all of the known problem
messages for runtime trouble, both at the I7 and the I6 level, are accompanied
by a call stack.  These call stacks are printed using phrases from the extension
Call Stack Tracking (which see), and we can customize them by changing the truth
states from Call Stack Tracking in a GRIF setup rule.  For example,

	*: A GRIF setup rule:
		now the call stack simplification flag is false.

The available flags are:

	Table of Call Stack Flags
	Flag	Default Value	Meaning
	the original arguments flag	false	whether functions' original arguments are shown
	the temporary named values flag	false	whether functions' temporary named values are shown
	the catch tokens flag	false	whether catch tokens generated by functions are shown
	the call stack simplification flag	true	whether internal routines are hidden
	the call frame numbering flag	false	whether call frames are numbered
	the terse call stack numbers flag	false	whether call frame numbers are shown without the text that explains that they are call frame numbers
	the call stack addresses flag	true	whether function addresses are shown

If the extension Interactive Debugger is also included, Verbose Diagnostics Lite
forgoes the call stack and instead forces a breakpoint.  We can then use all of
the debugger's facilities to diagnose the problem, including the debug command
"examine the call stack".

Chapter: Requirements, Limitations, and Bugs

This version was tested with Inform 6G60.  It will probably function on newer
versions, and it may function under slightly older versions, though there is no
guarantee.

Verbose Diagnostics Lite is subject to the caveats for the Glulx Runtime
Instrumentation Framework; see the requirements chapter in its documentation for
the technical details.

Section: Regarding bugs

If you encounter a bug, check first on the project website
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/) to see whether a newer version of
this extension is available.  If, even using the latest version, the fault
remains, please file a bug report: On the website, choose "Support" from the
toolbar and follow the link in the box titled "Best Way to Get Help".

I will try to respond quickly, at least with an estimate of when the bug might
be fixed, though sometimes I am away from the internet for a week or two at a
time.

Chapter: Acknowledgements

Verbose Diagnostics Lite was prepared as part of the Glulx Runtime
Instrumentation Project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/).  For this
first edition of the project, special thanks go to these people, in
chronological order:

- Graham Nelson, Emily Short, and others, not only for Inform, but also for the
  countless hours the high-quality technical documentation saved me and for the
  work that made the Glulx VM possible,

- Andrew Plotkin for the Glulx VM and the Glk library, as well as their clear,
  always up-to-date specifications,

- Jacqueline Lott, David Welbourn, and all of the other attendees for Club
  Floyd, my first connection to the interactive fiction community,

- Jesse McGrew and Emily Short for getting me involved with Inform 7,

- all of the Inform 7 developers for their hard work, the ceaseless flow of
  improvements, and their willingness to take me on as a collaborator,

- Ron Newcomb and Esteban Montecristo for the idea to write Call Stack Tracking
  and Verbose Diagnostics,

- Roger Carbol, Jesse McGrew, Michael Martin, Dan Shiovitz, Johnny Rivera, and
  everyone else for their helpful comments on ifMUD's I6 and I7 channels,

- Esteban Montecristo, for invaluable alpha testing,

- and all of the beta testers who are reading this.

For Verbose Diagnostics Lite in particular, I am grateful to
Esteban Montecristo for contributing the original code for block value errors.
