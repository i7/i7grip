Book "Extension Information"

[For each of the kinds defined by Disambiguation Framework you will see a sentence like

	A disambiguation feature is aborting disambiguation.

This bewildering statement actually sets up disambiguation features as a qualitative value with default value the disambiguation feature at address one, which, as we say, signifies a request to abort disambiguation.  (We could have gone with a quantitative kind for default zero, but then we would open up the possibility for arithmetic on the pointers.)  I wish it weren't necessary, but at least in this build Inform doesn't let us provide a default value any other way, and, moreover, we need a default value or else only I6 substitutions are allowed to decide on disambiguation features.]

Chapter "Use Options" - unindexed

To decide what number is the disambiguation hash table size: (- DF_DISAMBIGUATION_HASH_SIZE -).

Book "Runtime Checks"

Chapter "Messages" - unindexed

To fail at scoring a valid feature alternative list:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Disambiguation Framework[with explanation]I found a disambiguation question that I might ask and then discovered that one of the options would be impossible.  Probably my process for building questions is broken.[terminating the story]".

To fail at finding disambiguation choices:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Disambiguation Framework[with explanation]I found a set of parse trees that I considered distinct, but then I failed to find a disambiguation question that would differentiate them.  Therefore, one of those two steps must be buggy.[terminating the story]".

To fail at finding matches for a disambiguation choice:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Disambiguation Framework[with explanation]I pruned the possible matches according to a disambiguation question that should have differentiated them and ended up with no survivors.  Therefore, either the choices I offered were wrong or the pruning went awry.[terminating the story]".

Chapter "Canonicalization"

[Phase I: Copies of the candidate parse trees are canonicalized.]
[Not all members of canonical parse tree vertices are significant; only their parsemes and their tree structure count.]
[The main contract for canonicalization is that parse trees shall share a canonical form if and only if they have the same semantics.  Usually that means paring a parse tree down to an abstract syntax tree.]
[A canonicalization rulebook will be traversed once per parse tree vertex, visiting them from bottom to top (i.e., seeing the root last).  It may rewrite anything in the subtree rooted at the vertex to canonicalize.  If it changes the root of the subtree, it should store the new root as ``the parse tree vertex to canonicalize''; the parent and sibling pointers will be automatically updated at the end of the rulebook.]
[(An alternative design would be to run the rulebook once and give it access to the root.  But almost all rewrites are location-agnostic, so we get simpler code when they don't have to each reimplement the loop over vertices.)]

[Available to canonicalization rulebooks:
	the parse tree vertex to canonicalize, a mutable variable]

[Memory: Allocates one canonical tree per parse.]
[Reentrancy: Is push/pop balanced.]

Section "Public Canonicalization Variables"

The parse tree vertex to canonicalize is a parse tree vertex that varies.  The parse tree vertex to canonicalize is an invalid parse tree vertex.

Section "Canonicalization Subroutines" - unindexed

To canonicalize (A - a parse tree vertex) by (C - a rulebook) after its children:
	let the previous child be a null parse tree vertex;
	now the parse tree vertex to canonicalize is the first child of A;
	while the parse tree vertex to canonicalize is not null:
		let the next child be the right sibling of the parse tree vertex to canonicalize;
		canonicalize the parse tree vertex to canonicalize by C after its children;
		if the previous child is null:
			write the first child (the parse tree vertex to canonicalize) to A;
		otherwise:
			write the right sibling (the parse tree vertex to canonicalize) to the previous child;
		write the left sibling the previous child to the parse tree vertex to canonicalize;
		if the next child is null:
			write the last child (the parse tree vertex to canonicalize) to A;
		otherwise:
			write the left sibling (the parse tree vertex to canonicalize) to the next child;
		write the right sibling the next child to the parse tree vertex to canonicalize;
		write the parent A to the parse tree vertex to canonicalize;
		now the previous child is the parse tree vertex to canonicalize;
		now the parse tree vertex to canonicalize is the next child;
	now the parse tree vertex to canonicalize is A;
	traverse C.

To decide what parse tree vertex is the root of a new canonicalization by (C - a rulebook) of the parse tree rooted at (A - a parse tree vertex):
	push the parse tree vertex to canonicalize;
	canonicalize the parse tree vertex corresponding to A in a new clone of its tree by C after its children;
	let the result be the parse tree vertex to canonicalize;
	pop the parse tree vertex to canonicalize;
	write the left sibling a null parse tree vertex to the result;
	write the right sibling a null parse tree vertex to the result;
	write the parent a null parse tree vertex to the result;
	decide on the result.

Section "Canonicalization Client Subroutines" - unindexed

To decide whether the canonical tree rooted at (A - a parse tree vertex) is identical to the canonical tree rooted at (B - a parse tree vertex):
	unless the parseme of A is the parseme of B:
		decide no;
	let A's child be the first child of A;
	let B's child be the first child of B;
	while A's child is not null and B's child is not null:
		unless the canonical tree rooted at A's child is identical to the canonical tree rooted at B's child:
			decide no;
		now A's child is the right sibling of A's child;
		now B's child is the right sibling of B's child;
	if A's child is not null or B's child is not null:
		decide no;
	decide yes.

	repeat with the linked list vertex running through L:
		write the value the root of a new canonicalization by C of the parse tree rooted at the parse tree vertex key of the linked list vertex to the linked list vertex;
	decide on L.

Chapter "Scoring"

[Phase II: Parse trees are scored in several dimensions.]
[Higher scores are better, but the scale is not assumed to be anything but ordinal.  For example, the scores 1, 2, and 4 rate three trees in increasing order; the scores -701, 0, and 18, although different-seeming, give the same ordering and therefore lead to the same outcome.]
[Because scores are mostly for computing the Pareto front, I find it easier to think of them in the negative sense, as counting and penalizing flaws in less sensible parse trees rather than as counting and rewarding sensical features.]
[The results are undefined if, in a particular dimension, some trees are scored but others are not.]

[Available to scoring rulebooks:
	the root of the parse tree to score, an immutable variable
	the root of the canonicalized parse tree to score, an immutable variable
	give the parse tree to score (N - a number) point/points for (T - some text), a phrase to invoke once per tree/dimension combination]

[Memory: Allocates the parse tree score hash table and its values, which are linked lists.]
[Reentrancy: Is push/pop balanced except for the parse tree score hash table stack, which gains a push.  (See Phase IV.)]

	repeat with the linked list vertex running through L:
		score the parse tree rooted at the parse tree vertex key of the linked list vertex and having a canonical parse tree rooted at the parse tree vertex value of the linked list vertex with S.

Chapter "Unconditional Filtration"

[Phase III: Nonsensical parse trees are filtered out.]
[The primary filtration rulebook is invoked once per parse tree.  If any rule has the outcome ``filter out the parse tree'', the parse tree is discarded.  Then the same happens with the secondary filtration rulebook.]

[Available to filtration rulebooks:
	the root of the parse tree to filter, an immutable variable
	the root of the canonicalized parse tree to filter, an immutable variable
	filter out the parse tree, a rulebook outcome to produce if the parse tree is rejected
	..., phrases to access the other trees and their scores, which might be offered in the future]

Chapter "Global Disambiguation" - unindexed

[Phase IV: The interpretation on the Pareto front is chosen, if it is unique.]

[Memory: Deallocates the parse tree score hash table, its entries, and its linked list values.  If the argument list is filtered, the lost parse trees and their canonicalizations are also deallocated.]
[Reentrancy: Is push/pop balanced except for the parse tree score hash table stack, which is popped once.  (See Phase II.)]

A Pareto challenge outcome is a kind of value.  The Pareto challenge outcomes are Pareto victory, Pareto draw, Pareto defeat, and Pareto incomparability.

To decide what Pareto challenge outcome is the result of challenging (M - a linked list) with (L - a linked list):

Chapter "Local Disambiguation"

[Phase VI: The set of interpretations is pared down to a singleton by asking multiple-choice questions.]
[The phrase is given a set of mutually exclusive features and asked which one appears in the input's intended parse.  In some cases it may also be allowed to decide on "none of the offered disambiguation features", and it always has the option to decide on "aborting disambiguation".]

[Available to local disambiguation phrases:
	its first argument (a context-free parser), the parser from whom disambiguation is occuring
	its second argument (a linked list), the available alternatives; each linked list vertex should be converted to a disambiguation feature
	its third argument (a linked list), whether the phrase may decide on "none of the offered disambiguation features"]

[A matching trees list maps parse tree roots to unified canonical roots, just like the phase phrase's L.]
[A feature alternative list is a list whose vertices are copies of features.]

[The reason for grouping by beginning lexeme index first is to get more friendly disambiguation questions: ``Which do you mean, `mark' as a verb or `mark' as a person's name?'' rather than ``Which do you mean, `mark' as a person's name or `twain' as two fathoms?'']

		delete the offered feature alternative list;
		now the offered feature alternative list is a new copy of A;
		now the none-of-the-above-features offering is the leftovers flag;

To offer a feature alternative list for (L - a linked list):
	push the key the offered beginning lexeme index onto the offered beginning lexeme index stack;
	push the key the offered feature alternative list onto the offered feature alternative list stack;
	now the offered beginning lexeme index is zero;
	now the offered feature alternative list is an empty linked list;

	repeat with the hash table vertex running through the parse tree feature hash table:
		let the beginning index be the number key of the hash table vertex;
		let the comparable feature list be the linked list value of the hash table vertex;
		consider applying feature alternative lists beginning at lexeme index the beginning index that include an empty linked list and select from the pruned comparable feature list the comparable feature list to L;
	always check that the offered feature alternative list is not empty or else fail at finding disambiguation choices.

To decide whether the chosen feature alternative retains (A - a linked list vertex) (this is applying the chosen feature alternative):
	let the result be true;
	let the root be the parse tree vertex key of A;
	if the chosen feature alternative is null:
		repeat with the matching trees list running through the linked list values of the offered feature alternative list:

				now the result is false;
				break;
	otherwise:
		let the matching trees list be the linked list value of the chosen feature alternative;
		now the result is (whether or not the matching trees list contains the key the parse tree vertex key of A);
	if the result is false:
		delete the root and its descendants;
		let the canonical root be the parse tree vertex value of A;

		if the count is zero:

			remove the first occurrence of the key the canonical root from the canonical tree count list;
		otherwise:
			write the value the count to the canonical tree count vertex;
	decide on the result.

To destroy the parse tree feature hash table:
	repeat with the hash table vertex running through the parse tree feature hash table:
		let the comparable feature list be the linked list value of the hash table vertex;
		repeat with the feature running through the comparable feature list:
			delete the linked list value of the feature;
		delete the comparable feature list;
	delete the parse tree feature hash table;
	now the parse tree feature hash table is a hash table key popped off of the parse tree feature hash table stack.

Section "Local Disambiguation Kinds"

A disambiguation feature is a kind of value.  [In fact, an alias for a linked list vertex.]
A disambiguation feature is aborting disambiguation.  [See the note in the book "Extension Information."]
The specification of a disambiguation feature is "Disambiguation features are in fact a type alias for linked list vertices; a disambiguation phrase should convert each of the vertices it receives to a disambiguation feature.  Most of them represent a parseme appearing over a particular lexeme range.  The others are 'aborting disambiguation', which never appears in an alternatives list but can be decided on to abort disambiguation, and 'none of the offered disambiguation features', provided so that a phrase can decide on none of the alternatives offered."

To decide what disambiguation feature is none of the offered disambiguation features: (- 0 -).

To decide what parseme is the parseme of (A - a disambiguation feature):
	decide on the parseme key of A converted to a linked list vertex.

To decide what number is the beginning lexeme index of (A - a disambiguation feature):
	decide on the offered beginning lexeme index.

To decide what number is the end lexeme index of (A - a disambiguation feature):
	decide on the underlying number key of A converted to a linked list vertex.

Section "Local Disambiguation Phrase" - unindexed

To decide what linked list is (L - a linked list) after disambiguating locally with (D - a phrase (context-free parser, linked list, truth state) -> disambiguation feature) for (A - a context-free parser):
	while the canonical tree count list is not unit:
		initialize the parse tree feature hash table from L;
		offer a feature alternative list for L;
		let the chosen feature be D applied to A and the offered feature alternative list and the none-of-the-above-features offering;
		now the offered beginning lexeme index is a number key popped off of the offered beginning lexeme index stack;
		now the chosen feature alternative is the chosen feature converted to a linked list vertex;
		if the chosen feature alternative is an invalid linked list vertex:
			repeat with the root running through the parse tree vertex keys of L:
				delete the root and its descendants;
			delete L;
			delete the offered feature alternative list;
			now the offered feature alternative list is a linked list key popped off of the offered feature alternative list stack;
			destroy the parse tree feature hash table;
			repeat with the canonical root running through the parse tree vertex keys of the canonical tree count list:
				delete the canonical root and its descendants;
			delete the canonical tree count list;
			now the canonical tree count list is a linked list key popped off of the canonical tree count list stack;
			decide on an empty linked list;
		filter L by applying the chosen feature alternative;
		always check that L is not empty or else fail at finding matches for a disambiguation choice;
		delete the offered feature alternative list;
		now the offered feature alternative list is a linked list key popped off of the offered feature alternative list stack;
		destroy the parse tree feature hash table;
	delete the canonical tree count list;
	now the canonical tree count list is a linked list key popped off of the canonical tree count list stack;
	decide on L.

Chapter "Orchestration"

To decide what parse tree vertex is the root of the match for (S - a parseme) canonicalized by (C - a rulebook) and disambiguated by scores from (E - a rulebook) and primary filtration from (F - a rulebook) and secondary filtration from (G - a rulebook) and disambiguating choices from (D - a phrase (context-free parser, linked list, truth state) -> disambiguation feature):
	set up the disambiguation framework;
	let the possibilities be an empty linked list;
	repeat with the root running through matches for S:
		let the possibility be the parse tree vertex corresponding to the root in a new clone of its tree;
		push the key the possibility onto the possibilities;
	if the possibilities are empty:
		decide on a null parse tree vertex;
	now the possibilities are the possibilities after canonicalizing with C the parse trees rooted at the keys and storing the resulting roots as values;
	unless the possibilities are unit:
		score the parse trees rooted at the keys and canonically rooted at the values of the possibilities with E;
		now the possibilities are the possibilities after filtering with F the parse trees rooted at the keys and canonically rooted at the values;
		if the possibilities are empty:
			decide on a null parse tree vertex;
		unless the possibilities are unit:
			now the possibilities are the possibilities after filtering with G the parse trees rooted at the keys and canonically rooted at the values;
			if the possibilities are empty:
				decide on a null parse tree vertex;
			unless the possibilities are unit:
				now the possibilities are the possibilities after choosing the Pareto front if it has a unique canonical parse tree;
				if the possibilities are empty:
					decide on a null parse tree vertex;
				unless the possibilities are unit:
					now the possibilities are the possibilities after unifying identical canonical trees;
					if the possibilities are empty:
						decide on a null parse tree vertex;
					unless the possibilities are unit:
						now the possibilities are the possibilities after disambiguating locally with D for the owner of S;
						if the possibilities are empty:
							decide on a null parse tree vertex;
	let the result be the parse tree vertex value of the possibilities converted to a linked list vertex;
	[There might be several, equivalent possibilities, so we are careful to delete all of them.]
	repeat with the possibility running through the possibilities:
		let the root be the parse tree vertex key of the possibility;
		let the canonical root be the parse tree vertex value of the possibility;
		delete the root and its descendants;
		if the canonical root is not the result:
			delete the canonical root and its descendants;
	delete the possibilities;
	decide on the result.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: Synopsis

Disambiguation Framework adds disambiguation facilities to Context Free Parsing
Engine (and therefore to extensions that use that engine, like Punctuated Word
Parsing Engine).

Details are in the following chapters.

Chapter: Usage

Section: Background

Authors using this extension should be familiar with the documentation for
Context-Free Parsing Engine.

Section: Process

Chapter: Requirements, Limitations, and Bugs

This version was tested with Inform 6G60.  It will probably function on newer
versions, and it may function under slightly older versions, though there is no
guarantee.

Section: Regarding bugs

If you encounter a bug, check first on the project website
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/) to see whether a newer version of
this extension is available.  If, even using the latest version, the fault
remains, please file a bug report: On the website, choose "Support" from the
toolbar and follow the link in the box titled "Best Way to Get Help".

I will try to respond quickly, at least with an estimate of when the bug might
be fixed, though sometimes I am away from the internet for a week or two at a
time.
