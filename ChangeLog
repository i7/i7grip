	* ChangeLog: Cleaned out the changelog, which hadn't been used in
	some time.  From now on I'll mostly restrict the changelog to
	things that might be worth mentioning in release notes.  So new
	features and fixes for released bugs are certainly in, API changes
	will only be mentioned for public rules and phrases, etc.
	Incremental gains won't appear until the new feature or bug fix is
	ready for release.
