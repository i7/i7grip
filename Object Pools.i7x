Book "Extension Information"

[For each of the kinds defined by Object Pools you will see a sentence like

	A object pool is an invalid object pool.

This bewildering statement actually sets up object pools as a qualitative value with default value the object pool at address one, which, as we say, is invalid.  (We could have gone with a quantitative kind for default zero, but then we would open up the possibility for arithmetic on the pointers.)  I wish it weren't necessary, but at least in this build Inform doesn't let us provide a default value any other way, and, moreover, we need a default value or else only I6 substitutions are allowed to decide on object pools.]

Chapter "Environment Checks"

An environment check rule (this is the check for dynamic memory allocation to support object pools rule):
	always check that memory allocation is supported or else say "[low-level runtime failure in]Object Pools[with explanation]This story uses object pools, which in turn depend on dynamic memory allocation.  But this interpreter doesn't allow dynamic memory allocation, meaning that the story cannot safely run.[terminating the story]".

Book "Object Pools"

Chapter "Object Pools"

Section "The Object Pool Kind"

An object pool is a kind of value.
An object pool is an invalid object pool.  [See the note in the book "Extension Information."]
The specification of an object pool is "Object pools reserve memory for allocations of a particular type, which can speed up the process of finding space for an allocation so long as the reserved space doesn't run out.  In general, an object pool only makes sense if objects are created and destroyed frequently, and, at the same time, the total number of objects in existence tends to stay below a given bound."

Section "The Object Pool Structure" - unindexed

[Layout:
	4 bytes for the object size (in bytes, which we call M [it must be at least four; see the layout below]) (at offset -8 bytes)
	4 bytes for the pool size (the total in bytes, which, letting N be the number of available objects, is N times M) (at offset -4 bytes)
	4 bytes for the next available object address
	M*N_0 bytes for the reserved memory (N_0 means the initial value of N, which must be nonnegative)]

	4 bytes for the pointer to the next unallocated object
	M-4 bytes left over]

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: Synopsis

Object Pools is a low-level extension for speeding up temporary memory
allocations when many of them have the same size.  It is only useful in code
that would otherwise invoke Glulx's malloc directly---a debugging extension for
instance, but not a typical story.

Details are in the following chapters.

Chapter: Usage

Section: Introduction

Whenever an instruction in a story file accesses memory, the interpreter has to
convert from the Glulx memory address to the address in its own memory where the
data is actually stored.  For statically allocated memory this is fairly easy;
it just adds one offset if the address is in ROM and another if the address is
in RAM (and the offsets might be the same).  But for memory in the dynamically
allocated range, it must first determine which allocation the address is inside
of, and only then can it add the appropriate offset.  The speed of this lookup
depends mostly on how many separate allocations the story has outstanding---more
allocations means more possibilities to consider.

Therefore, considering that memory accesses are quite common, it's to our
advantage to limit our allocation count.  For the fairly common case where we
can identify a family of like-sized allocations, there's a standard technique we
can use---an object pool.

An "object pool", in computer science terms, is a collection of unused, equally
sized memory blocks set aside for future use.  We "allocate" a block from a pool
simply by removing it from the collection; we "free" a block by adding it back
in.  If ever we need more blocks than are on hand, we ask the interpreter for a
large chunk of new memory, divide it up into blocks, and then place them in the
pool.  Thus, we only pay for the number of refills, not the number of blocks.

Section: Ordinary object pools

The ordinary object pools defined by this extension are of the kind

	an object pool

The default value for this kind is

	an invalid object pool

which, as one might expect, cannot actually be used to make allocations.  It is
an error to use an invalid pool in any of the extension's phrases.

To create a useful value, we call on the phrase

	a new permanent object pool with (N - a number) objects of size (M - a number) bytes

which decides on a pool holding N blocks of M bytes and the policy that the
total number of blocks should double whenever the pool is exhausted.  Note that
M is required to be at least four, but this isn't much of a restriction when
four or fewer bytes can just as well be stored directly as by address.

We gain access to allocations by requesting

	a memory allocation from (A - an object pool)

which will return the address of an unused size-M block---we usually want to
apply the conversion phrases from Low-Level Operations to give the block the
appropriate kind.  When we are done with a block, we invoke the phrase

	free the memory allocation at address (X - a number) to (A - an object pool)

after which the address X should be considered invalid, at least until it's
recycled and returned again by the allocating phrase.

Section: Batch object pools

Batch object pools are like ordinary object pools, except specialized for
situations where allocations are made in batches and no allocations survive from
one batch to the next.  As with ordinary object pools, batch object pools have a
kind:

	a batch object pool

and a default value for that kind, which is not a valid argument to the
extension's phrases:

	an invalid batch object pool

The similarities continue with the phrase for creating a valid batch object pool:

	a new permanent batch object pool with (N - a number) objects of size (M - a number) bytes

and for obtaining a memory allocation from it:

	a memory allocation from (A - a batch object pool)

The only difference is in how allocations are freed.  We use the phrase

	free the memory allocations made from (A - a batch object pool)

which frees every outstanding allocation at once.

Chapter: Requirements, Limitations, and Bugs

This version was tested with Inform 6G60.  It will probably function on newer
versions, and it may function under slightly older versions, though there is no
guarantee.

Section: Regarding bugs

If you encounter a bug, check first on the project website
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/) to see whether a newer version of
this extension is available.  If, even using the latest version, the fault
remains, please file a bug report: On the website, choose "Support" from the
toolbar and follow the link in the box titled "Best Way to Get Help".

I will try to respond quickly, at least with an estimate of when the bug might
be fixed, though sometimes I am away from the internet for a week or two at a
time.
