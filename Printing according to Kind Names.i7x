Book "Extension Information"

Chapter "Use Options" - unindexed

Use a kind name hash table size of at least 311 translates as (- Constant PKN_NAME_HASH_SIZE={N}; -).

To decide what number is the kind name hash table size: (- PKN_NAME_HASH_SIZE -).

Chapter "Rulebooks"

The kind printing setup rules are [rulebook is] a rulebook.

Chapter "Temporary Workarounds" - unindexed

To decide whether the understood value (X - a number) with the base kind code (C - a number) is valid in the command (T - some text) using a workaround for Inform bug 825:
	decide on whether or not the understood value X with the base kind code C is valid in the command T.

To say the understood value (X - a number) with the base kind code (C - a number) in the command (T - some text) using a workaround for Inform bug 825:
	say "[the understood value X with the base kind code C in the command T]".

To decide what text is the validation error for (X - a number) using the kind parse rooted at (V - a parse tree vertex) and a workaround for Inform bug 848:
	decide on the validation error for X using the kind parse rooted at V.

To say the kind parse rooted at (V - a parse tree vertex) with plural flag (F - a truth state) and a workaround for Inform bug 848:
	say "[the kind parse rooted at V with plural flag F]".

Book "Runtime Checks"

Chapter "Messages" - unindexed

To fail at building a semi-punctuated word array from changing text:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Printing according to Kind Names[with explanation]I tried to build a semi-punctuated word array from some text, which means first counting the number of words and then recording each of them.  But the recording process came up with a different number of words than I had originally counted, which means that this text is changing as I print it.[terminating the story]".

To fail at finding kind parameters in (V - a parse tree vertex):
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Printing according to Kind Names[with explanation]I was trying to print a value with a given parameterized kind, like 'list of _', but I wasn't able to fill in the blank.  In case it's helpful, the kind parse tree looked like this:[paragraph break][V converted to a parse tree vertex with indentation][terminating the story]".

To fail at finding the expected number of children when canonicalizing parse tree vertices for rules and rulebooks:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Printing according to Kind Names[with explanation]I was cleaning up my parse of a kind name and found more parameterization of a rule or rulebook kind than should be possible.  That means that my canonicalization code, which performs that clean-up, must have failed recently.[terminating the story]".

To fail at saying a value according to a nonexistent previous kind name parse:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Printing according to Kind Names[with explanation]I was asked to say a value according to the most recently parsed kind name, but there way no most recently parsed kind name.[terminating the story]".

To fail at saying a nonexistent previous kind name parse:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Printing according to Kind Names[with explanation]I was asked to say the most recently parsed kind name, but there way no most recently parsed kind name.[terminating the story]".

To fail at saying a previous kind name parse that was not understood:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Printing according to Kind Names[with explanation]I was asked to say the most recently parsed kind name unambiguously, but I didn't understand it, so I can't then identify or remove any ambiguities.[terminating the story]".

To fail at saying a kind because of (S - a parseme):
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Printing according to Kind Names[with explanation]I was asked to say a kind, but was unable to find all of the entries in my kind name bookkeeping; it might be corrupted.  In case it's helpful, one offending parseme was [S converted to a parseme].[terminating the story]".

Chapter "Kind Name Printing Hash Tables" - unindexed

[Maps kind parsemes to the singular and plural names (without articles) for their kinds, unless those names are parameterized.]
The singular kind name hash table is a hash table that varies.
The plural kind name hash table is a hash table that varies.

To associate the kind name parseme (S - a parseme) with the singular (T - some text) and the plural (U - some text):
	insert the key S and the value T into the singular kind name hash table;
	insert the key S and the value U into the plural kind name hash table.

To decide what text is the kind name for (S - a parseme) with plural flag (F - a truth state):
	let the result be some text;
	if F is true:
		now the result is the first text value matching the key S in the plural kind name hash table or "" if there are no matches;
	otherwise:
		now the result is the first text value matching the key S in the singular kind name hash table or "" if there are no matches;
	if the result is empty:
		fail at saying a kind because of S;
	decide on the result.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: Synopsis

Printing according to Kind Names is a low-level extension for debugging tools.
It lets them safely say values in a human-understandable way, even when they're
stored as the wrong kind.  For instance, a line like

	say 273837 according to the kind named "person";

might produce the text

	"yourself"

Details are in the following chapters.

Chapter: Usage

Section: Preliminaries

Printing according to Kind Names depends on Debug File Parsing, which requires
some setup outside of the story file---see that extension's documentation.

Section: Phrases

After the preliminaries, there are only two phrases to worry about.  The first,

	if there is a kind named (T - some text):
		....

tests whether T is a legal and complete kind name; the condition will (in most
stories) hold for "list of people", but (in most stories) fail for "list".
Kinds of kinds are not kinds, so, for instance, there is (again, in most
stories) no kind named "sayable value".

The second phrase,

	say (X - a number) according to the kind named (T - some text)

prints X as if if has the kind named by T, failing gracefully if that's not
possible.  For example, if we use a conversion phrase from Low-Level Operations,
we could write

	let foo be yourself converted to a number;
	say foo according to the kind named "person";

and get the expected output

	"yourself"

whereas code like

	say four according to the kind named "person";

will serve up

	"<invalid object>"

More generally, we can expect text in the form

	"<invalid ...>"

whenever T names a valid kind but X cannot possibly match it.  If T isn't even a
legal kind name, as in

	say four according to the kind named "bogus";

then X is printed as a number with a parenthetical explanation:

	"4 (unable to format a value of this kind)"

Chapter: Requirements, Limitations, and Bugs

This version was tested with Inform 6G60.  It will probably function on newer
versions, and it may function under slightly older versions, though there is no
guarantee.

Section: Regarding bugs

If you encounter a bug, check first on the project website
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/) to see whether a newer version of
this extension is available.  If, even using the latest version, the fault
remains, please file a bug report: On the website, choose "Support" from the
toolbar and follow the link in the box titled "Best Way to Get Help".

I will try to respond quickly, at least with an estimate of when the bug might
be fixed, though sometimes I am away from the internet for a week or two at a
time.
