Book "Extension Information"

[For each of the kinds defined by Binary Input Files you will see a sentence like

	A binary input file stream is an invalid binary input file stream.

This bewildering statement actually sets up binary input file streams as a qualitative value with default value the binary input file stream at address one, which, as we say, is invalid.  (We could have gone with a quantitative kind for default zero, but then we would open up the possibility for arithmetic on the pointers.)  I wish it weren't necessary, but at least in this build Inform doesn't let us provide a default value any other way, and, moreover, we need a default value or else only I6 substitutions are allowed to decide on binary input file streams.]

Chapter "Use Options" - unindexed

Use a binary input file stream buffer length of at least 65536 translates as (- Constant BIF_BUFFER_LENGTH={N}; -).

To decide what number is the binary input file stream buffer length: (- BIF_BUFFER_LENGTH -).

Book "Runtime Checks"

Chapter "Runtime Checks"

An environment check rule (this is the check for dynamic memory allocation to support Binary Input Files rule):
	always check that memory allocation is supported or else say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]This story uses persistent binary input files, which in turn depend on dynamic memory allocation.  But this interpreter doesn't allow dynamic memory allocation, so the story cannot run.[terminating the story]".

Chapter "Messages" - unindexed

To fail at finding an allocated rock for a binary input file:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to allocated a rock to a binary input file, but they were all in use.  Try defining the I6 constant BIF_ROCK_COUNT as a larger value.  (Currently it is [the maximum number of rocks available for binary input files]).[terminating the story]".

To fail at opening an invalid binary input file stream for a file named (F - some text):
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I was asked to use an invalid stream to open the file named '[F converted to some text]' (without the surrounding quotes).[terminating the story]".

To fail at opening an invalid binary input file stream for blorb resource (R - a number):
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I was asked to use an invalid stream to open the resource numbered '[R converted to a number]'.[terminating the story]".

To fail at opening a binary input file stream for a file named (F - some text):
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to use a stream to open the file named '[F converted to some text]' (without the surrounding quotes), but Glk rejected that file name.  It might be invalid, or I might not have permission to read the file, or the file name might refer to a broken symbolic link, or there might be no such file at all.[terminating the story]".

To fail at opening a binary input file stream for blorb resource (R - a number):
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to use a stream to open the resource numbered '[R converted to a number]', but Glk rejected that resource number.[terminating the story]".

To fail at clearing position information in a closed binary input file stream:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to clear position information in a binary input file stream that was closed.  But that doesn't make sense, because I should only make such an attempt after I've successfully opened a stream.[terminating the story]".

To fail at opening a binary input file stream for a second file named (F - some text):
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to use a stream to open the file '[F converted to some text]', but it was already open for reading another file or resource.[terminating the story]".

To fail at opening a binary input file stream for a second resource numbered (R - a number):
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to use a stream to open the resource numbered '[R converted to a number]', but it was already open for reading another file or resource.[terminating the story]".

To fail at reopening a binary input file stream that isn't open:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to decide whether I needed to reopen a file after a restore or an undo, but part of my bookkeeping says yes while the other part says no.  Something must have gone wrong before the save or the undo checkpoint.[terminating the story]".

To fail at using a null binary input file reference for the file named (F - some text):
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I asked Glk for a file reference to the file '[F converted to some text]', but it returned null.[terminating the story]".

To fail at scrolling a closed binary input file stream:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to scroll a binary input file stream, but it was closed.[terminating the story]".

To fail at reading (N - a number) bytes when the available bytes are insufficient:
	if N is greater than the binary input file stream buffer length:
		let the thousands count be N divided by 1000;
		increment the thousands count;
		say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to read [N converted to a number] bytes from a binary input file stream, but there weren't that many available.  The buffer size is [the binary input file stream buffer length] bytes, and I can only read that many at once.  If you need a larger buffer, try adding a line like[line break][line break][fixed letter spacing]    Use a binary input file stream buffer length of at least [the thousands count times 1000].[variable letter spacing][warning type][line break][line break]to the source text.[terminating the story]";
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to read [N converted to a number] bytes from a binary input file stream, but there weren't that many available.  The end of the file appeared first.[terminating the story]".
 
To fail at reading up through character code (C - a number) when the available bytes are insufficient:
	let the thousands count be the binary input file stream buffer length divided by 1000;
	increment the thousands count;
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Binary Input Files[with explanation]I tried to read up through character code [C converted to a number] from a binary input file stream, but there weren't enough bytes available for me to find that code within the span of one buffer.  It may help to know that the buffer size is [the binary input file stream buffer length] bytes.  You can increase it by adding a line like[line break][line break][fixed letter spacing]    Use a binary input file stream buffer length of at least [the thousands count times 1000].[variable letter spacing][warning type][line break][line break]to the source text.[terminating the story]".

Book "Binary Input File Streams"

Chapter "The Binary Input File Stream Kind"

A binary input file stream is a kind of value.
A binary input file stream is an invalid binary input file stream.  [See the note in the book "Extension Information."]
The specification of a binary input file stream is "A binary input file stream is a data structure that represents the binary contents of a file.  The streams provided by this extension are specifically for use by Debug File Parsing.  As such, they treat files a little differently than Inform normally does: we have control over when a stream has a file open, and in particular we can keep a file open across multiple turns or even a save and restore. The sole use case also means that some operations traditionally supported by binary input streams are not present.  These streams are good for jumping to a known offset and reading data sequentially; they are a poor choice for random access operations, and they do not support writing at all."

Chapter "Stream Recovery"

Section "Stream Recovery Data Structures" - unindexed

The moribund stream id linked list is a linked list that varies.

Section "Stream Recovery Handlers"

[We can't actually do anything useful until the iteration is done; we must wait until the ``tie up loose ends'' phrase.  Here we would note the ids that have been invalidated, but we're going to conservatively invalidate all of them anyway; do nothing.]
[A Glulx zeroing-reference rule (this is the invalidate binary input file ids rule):
	do nothing.]

[Same here in that we can only note what to do, not do it.  Since we plan on invalidating and reopening for every stream, the streams left over from the last run all need to be closed.]
A Glulx resetting-streams rule (this is the associating a binary input file stream id with a stream given a rock rule):
	if the moribund stream id linked list is an invalid linked list:
		now the moribund stream id linked list is an empty linked list;
	if the rock current Glulx rock is for a binary input file:
		push the key the current Glulx rock-ref onto the moribund stream id linked list.

[Finally, we can act.  Two steps: close all of the old streams, and reopen the ones the story thinks should be open.]
A Glulx object-updating rule (this is the tying up loose ends after associating binary input file ids rule):
	if the moribund stream id linked list is an invalid linked list:
		now the moribund stream id linked list is an empty linked list;
	if the open binary input file stream linked list is an invalid linked list:
		now the open binary input file stream linked list is an empty linked list;
	while the moribund stream id linked list is not empty:
		let the stream id be a number key popped off of the moribund stream id linked list; [this line and the next must be separate because of Inform bug 770]
		close the binary input file stream with id stream id;
	repeat with the open binary input file stream running through the binary input file stream keys of the open binary input file stream linked list:
		reopen the open binary input file stream.

Section "Recovery Shielding" (for use with Glulx Runtime Instrumentation Framework by Brady Garvin)

[If we don't shield IdentifyGlkObject against instrumentation, it or one of its eventual callees might be called for the first time in an instrumented context.

[Scroll so that the given byte is the first byte in the buffer.]
To move (A - a binary input file stream) to stream position (P - a number) (this is moving a binary input file stream to a different position):

	scroll A.

To move (A - a binary input file stream) to stream position (P - a number) expecting to read only (N - a number) byte/bytes (this is moving a binary input file stream to a different position with an expected read length):
	let the distance be P minus the stream position of A;
	advance the stream position and offset by the distance in A;
	expect A to read N bytes.

To expect (A - a binary input file stream) to read (N - a number) byte/bytes (this is expecting the number of bytes a binary input file stream will read):
	let the next buffer offset be the next buffer offset of A;

Binary Input Files ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: Synopsis

Binary Input Files is a support extension for Debug File Parsing.  (So, apart
from the notes in the Requirements, Limitations, and Bugs chapter, most authors
can safely ignore this documentation.)  It provides low-level access to buffered
Glk streams and allows these streams to remain open over several turns, properly
reopening them in case of a save/restore.

Details are in the following chapters.

Chapter: Usage

Section: Overview

A binary input file stream is a data structure that represents the binary
contents of a file.  The streams provided by this extension are specifically for
use by Debug File Parsing.  As such, they treat files a little differently than
Inform normally does: we have control over when a stream has a file open, and in
particular we can keep a file open across multiple turns or even a save and
restore.

The sole use case also means that some operations traditionally supported by
binary input streams are not present.  These streams are good for jumping to a
known offset and reading data sequentially; they are a poor choice for random
access operations, and they do not support writing at all.

Section: Creating and opening streams

To request a new, unopened stream, we ask for

	a new binary input file stream

Once we have an unopened stream, we can open it for a file with the phrase

	open (S - a binary input file stream) for the binary input file name (F - some text)

The file name must not contain substitutions or non-Latin-1 characters.  As
always, the interpreter has leave to mangle it and add a file extension if it
sees fit.  And for security reasons the interpreter controls the directory where
we look for the file.

If the file cannot be opened, Binary Input Files will terminate the story with
an error message.  Otherwise, the stream's position will be set to the beginning
of the file, ready for reading.

Section: Inspecting streams

We are always able to check whether a stream is open or closed by testing

	if (S - a binary input file stream) is open:
		....

or

	if (S - a binary input file stream) is closed:
		....

For open streams only we can ask for the file name:

	the file name of (S - a binary input file stream)

the current position within that file (the number of bytes between the beginning
position and the next byte that we will read):

	the stream position of (S - a binary input file stream)

and the size of the file, which is to say the first unreadable position (again in bytes):

	the end-of-stream position of (S - a binary input file stream)

Section: Moving within streams

We may move to an absolute position within a stream by writing

	move (S - a binary input file stream) to stream position (P - a number)

and if we know how much data we are going to read, we can give the extension a
hint to improve performance:

	move (S - a binary input file stream) to stream position (P - a number) expecting to read only (N - a number) byte/bytes

Hints can also be given on their own, either as

	expect (S - a binary input file stream) to read (N - a number) bytes

or as

	scroll (S - a binary input file stream)

where the latter means, more or less, "prepare to read a lot of data".

Relative movement is also an option, so long as it is in the forward direction.
The appropriate phrase is

	skip (N - a number) byte/bytes in (S - a binary input file stream)

where N must be nonnegative.

And in one way we can predicate our movement on the file contents, skipping
bytes until we have passed over a particular value (usually a Latin-1 character
code):

	skip the text in (S - a binary input file stream) up through character code (C - a number)

For character codes 0 (a null terminator) and 10 (a newline), we also have more
legible versions of the previous phrase:

	skip the text in (S - a binary input file stream) up through the next null terminator

	skip the text in (S - a binary input file stream) up through the next newline

Section: Reading raw data

To read binary data directly, we ask for

	the address where the next (N - a number) byte/bytes is/are available in (S - a binary input file stream)

So long as the stream remains untouched, its upcoming N bytes can be found at
that address and inspected with the phrases from Low-Level Operations.  But as
soon the stream moves those memory contents are subject to change.

Section: Reading numbers

To read a number, we can use one of four phrases, depending on the number of
bytes that we would like to read:

	the next byte in (S - a binary input file stream)

	the next short in (S - a binary input file stream)

	the next triple in (S - a binary input file stream)

	the next integer in (S - a binary input file stream)

These correspond to one, two, three, and four bytes respectively.  Multi-byte
words are read in big-endian order.  Reading advances the stream position past
the data that was read.

Section: Reading text

For Latin-1 data, we can allocate new text values whose contents are copied from
the file (see the extension Low-Level Text for details on synthetic text).  We
normally do so by reading characters until a particular one is encountered:

	a new synthetic text extracted from (S - a binary input file stream) until character code (C - a number)

The stream position passes over the character C, but it is not included in the
synthetic text.  As in skipping, the are slightly more legible phrases for
reading until a null terminator or newline:

	a new synthetic text extracted from (S - a binary input file stream) until a null terminator

and

	a new synthetic text extracted from (S - a binary input file stream) until a newline

(The latter also trims any trailing carriage return, which is useful
when the file uses Windows or mixed newlines.)

Permanent text is also supported; we need only insert the word "permanent" in
the phrase.  For instance,

	a new permanent synthetic text extracted from (S - a binary input file stream) until a newline

Section: Closing and destroying streams

Streams should be closed as soon as we are finished with a file, to ensure that
the pool of Glk rocks isn't depleted.  The phrase to use is

	close (S - a binary input file stream)

We can then reopen the stream with another file, or, if we do not need it
anymore, we should delete it to free up memory:

	delete (S - a binary input file stream)

Chapter: Requirements, Limitations, and Bugs

This version was tested with Inform 6G60.  It will probably function on newer
versions, and it may function under slightly older versions, though there is no
guarantee.

Binary Input Files is willing to keep files open across several turns, whereas
Inform will normally never do so.  This behavior adds complications to the
save/restore process: If Binary Input Files has a file open during a save, it
must be able to reopen that same file, unchanged, when the story is restored.
In most cases where it cannot, it will complain and terminate the story, but its
checks are not fool-proof, and you should not rely on this behavior.

In particular, you should not include Binary Input Files in a publicly released
story because you cannot prevent a player from changing a file between a save
and a restore.  Binary Input Files is only meant to be used in development
tools, such as the debugging extensions supported by Debug File Parsing.

Section: Compatibility with other extensions

Binary Input Files uses Glk rocks to keep track of the streams that it owns
across save/restore boundaries.  Unfortunately, there is no convention (that I
know of) for how extensions choose the rocks that they own.  Binary Input Files
will normally use rocks from -100 up through -85, a range that seems unclaimed
at the time of writing, but we can select a different range if there is a
conflict.  The chapter replacement

	*: Chapter "Modified Rock Range" (in place of Chapter "Rock Range" in Binary Input Files by Brady Garvin)
	
	Include (-
		Constant BIF_MINIMUM_ROCK = 400;
		Constant BIF_ROCK_COUNT = 50;
	-) after "Definitions.i6t".

for instance, will assign Binary Input Files the rocks 400 through 449 instead.
(If you are using an older version of Inform, 6G60 or earlier, the snippet above
might not display or paste correctly.  Instead, you should open the extension,
search for "Modified Rock Range", and copy and paste from there.)

Binary Input Files also replaces the I6 stub IdentifyGlkObject with a routine of
its own.  If other extensions try to do the same, you will receive error
messages from the I6 compiler.  Consult your local I6 guru (or the gurus on a
forum like http://www.intfiction.org/forum/) for a fix; the correction to make
depends on what the other extension is trying to do.  You can also send a bug
report as explained in the next chapter.

Section: Regarding bugs

If you encounter a bug, check first on the project website
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/) to see whether a newer version of
this extension is available.  If, even using the latest version, the fault
remains, please file a bug report: On the website, choose "Support" from the
toolbar and follow the link in the box titled "Best Way to Get Help".

I will try to respond quickly, at least with an estimate of when the bug might
be fixed, though sometimes I am away from the internet for a week or two at a
time.
