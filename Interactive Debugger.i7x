Book "Runtime Checks"

Chapter "Messages" - unindexed

To fail at requesting multiple debug commands:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]I tried to request a debug command before the previous request had been fulfilled.[terminating the story]".

To fail at finding a disambiguation choice:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]I tried to disambiguate a command, but I lost track of the disambiguation choices I had offered you.[terminating the story]".

To fail at synchronizing disambiguation trees:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]I tried to disambiguate a command, but I found ambiguities that should have already been resolved by the disambiguation choices I had offered you.[terminating the story]".

To fail at finding a routine record for a sequence point with a source line record:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]I tried to find the debug information for a function, but couldn't, even though I have debug information for lines within that function.[terminating the story]".

To fail at finding I7 in a line shared by several routines:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]I tried to find the routine containing a line of I7, but found either zero or several routines.[terminating the story]".

To fail at encountering a divider in the last-seen call stack:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]As the call stack was not empty when I last showed the debug prompt, I would have expected one of its frames to have been selected at that time too.  But my bookkeeping argues otherwise.[terminating the story]".

To fail at matching a divider when finish is ignoring an interruption:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]As the call stack was not enough of an argument to convince the debug command 'finish' to consider itself complete, I would have expected the frame that was selected when I last showed the debug prompt to still be around.  But my bookkeeping argues otherwise.[terminating the story]".

To fail at finding a routine record for a kernel:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]I was able to find a routine kernel, but no routine record for that kernel, which is awfully strange.  Probably my bookkeeping has been corrupted.[terminating the story]".

To fail at forcing a breakpoint from the debugger in an unknown coexecution state:
	say "[runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]I failed to consistently determine the execution state of the story, and am unable to report any caveats that might apply to this forced breakpoint, or even whether it will apply at all.[continuing anyway]".

To fail at being the first to run the story:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]I tried to run the story for the first time, but my bookkeeping indicates that it is already running.  I must therefore be confused.[terminating the story]".

To fail at recovering the debugger windows:
	say "[low-level runtime failure in]Interactive Debugger[with explanation]I couldn't tell which of the existing windows are the ones belonging to the debugger, and am therefore unable to reclaim them.[terminating the story]".

	say "[line break]Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.";
	say "[line break]Preamble";
	say "[paragraph break]The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.";
	say "[line break]The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to your programs, too.";
	say "[line break]When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.";
	say "[line break]To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.";
	say "[line break]For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.";
	say "[line break]Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.";
	say "[line break]For the developers['] and authors['] protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users['] and authors['] sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.";
	say "[line break]Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users['] freedom to change the software.  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.";
	say "[line break]Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.";

	say "[paragraph break]TERMS AND CONDITIONS";
	say "[paragraph break]0. Definitions.";
	say "[line break]'This License' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.";
	say "[line break]'Copyright' also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.";
	say "[line break]'The Program' refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.  Each licensee is addressed as 'you'.  'Licensees' and 'recipients' may be individuals or organizations.";
	say "[line break]To 'modify' a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a 'modified version' of the earlier work or a work 'based on' the earlier work.";
	say "[line break]A 'covered work' means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.";
	say "[line break]To 'propagate' a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.";
	say "[line break]To 'convey' a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.";
	say "[line break]An interactive user interface displays 'Appropriate Legal Notices' to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.";
	say "[paragraph break]1. Source Code.";
	say "[line break]The 'source code' for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  'Object code' means any non-source form of a work.";
	say "A 'Standard Interface' means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.";
	say "[line break]The 'System Libraries' of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A 'Major Component', in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.";
	say "[line break]The 'Corresponding Source' for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.";
	say "[line break]The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.";

This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.";
	say "[line break]You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.";
	say "[line break]Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.";
	say "[paragraph break]3. Protecting Users['] Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.";
	say "[line break]No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.";
	say "[line break]When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties['] legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.";
	say "[paragraph break]4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.";
	say "[line break]You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.";
	say "[line break]You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.";
	say "[paragraph break]5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.";
	say "[line break]You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:";
	say "[paragraph break]a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.";
	say "[line break]b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to 'keep intact all notices'.";
	say "[line break]c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.";
	say "[line break]d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.";
	say "[line break]A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an 'aggregate' if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.";
	say "[paragraph break]6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.";
	say "[line break]You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:";
	say "[paragraph break]a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.";
	say "[line break]b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.";
	say "[line break]c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.";
	say "[line break]d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.";
	say "[line break]e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.";
	say "[line break]A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.";
	say "[line break]A 'User Product' is either (1) a 'consumer product', which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user, 'normally used' refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.";
	say "[line break]'Installation Information' for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.";
	say "[line break]If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).";
	say "[line break]The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.";
	say "[line break]Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.";
	say "[paragraph break]7. Additional Terms.";
	say "[line break]'Additional permissions' are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.";
	say "[line break]When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.";
	say "[line break]Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:";
	say "[paragraph break]a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or";
	say "[paragraph break]b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or";
	say "[paragraph break]c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or";
	say "[paragraph break]d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or";
	say "[paragraph break]e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or";
	say "[paragraph break]f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.";
	say "[line break]All other non-permissive additional terms are considered 'further restrictions' within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.";
	say "[line break]If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.";
	say "[line break]Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.";
	say "[paragraph break]8. Termination.";
	say "[line break]You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).";
	say "[line break]However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.";
	say "[line break]Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.";
	say "[line break]Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.";
	say "[paragraph break]9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.";
	say "[line break]You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.";
	say "[paragraph break]10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.";
	say "[line break]Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.";
	say "[line break]An 'entity transaction' is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.";
	say "[line break]You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.";
	say "[paragraph break]11. Patents.";
	say "[line break]A 'contributor' is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's 'contributor version'.";
	say "[line break]A contributor's 'essential patent claims' are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For purposes of this definition, 'control' includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.";
	say "[line break]Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version.";
	say "[line break]In the following three paragraphs, a 'patent license' is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).  To 'grant' such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.";
	say "[line break]If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients.  'Knowingly relying' means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.";
	say "[line break]If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it.";
	say "[line break]A patent license is 'discriminatory' if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.";
	say "[line break]Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.";
	say "[paragraph break]12. No Surrender of Others['] Freedom.";
	say "[line break]If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.";
	say "[paragraph break]13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.";
	say "[line break]Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.";
	say "[paragraph break]14. Revised Versions of this License.";
	say "[line break]The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.";
	say "[line break]Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.";
	say "[line break]If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.";
	say "[line break]Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.";
	say "[paragraph break]15. Disclaimer of Warranty.";
	say "[line break]THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.";
	say "[paragraph break]16. Limitation of Liability.";
	say "[line break]IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.";
	say "[paragraph break]17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.";
	say "[line break]If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.";

To decide what number is the universal breakpoint flag index for the sequence point (A - a number) according to the debugger (this is choosing the universal breakpoint flag index for a sequence point according to the debugger):
	let the routine record be the routine record owning the sequence point A;
	if the routine record is not an invalid routine record and the function at address the function address of the routine record is elided in the simplified call stack:
		decide on zero;
	decide on one.

The phrase that chooses the universal breakpoint flag index for a sequence point is choosing the universal breakpoint flag index for a sequence point according to the debugger.

[Roughly speaking, true unless all call frames and call sites in the current stack and the last-seen one match up.]
To decide whether the call frame changes warrant a distinction from the previous interruptions:
	let the previous call frame be the last-seen call stack root;
	let the current call frame be the root of the debugger's current call frame;
	if the current call frame is null or the previous call frame is null:
		decide on whether or not the current call frame is not the previous call frame;

		now the current call frame is the inward link of the current call frame;
		now the previous call frame is the inward link of the previous call frame.

A debugger change direction is a kind of value.  The debugger change directions are a change inward from the reference frame, a change within the reference frame, and a change outward from the reference frame.  The specification of a debugger change direction is "When one of the internal breakpoints for commands like step and next is triggered, the debugger uses debugger change directions to decide whether the breakpoint was fired in the expected way or is merely a false alarm."

To decide whether this interruption should be ignored by the control flow command:
	[The continue command ignores every such thing.]
	if the debugger's control flow state is responding after a continue:
		decide yes;
	[While the sequence point step command never ignores anything.]
	if the debugger's control flow state is responding after a sequence point step:
		decide no;
	let the previous call frame be the last-seen call stack root;
	let the current call frame be the root of the debugger's current call frame;
	[We ought not obliterate the call stack, but, if we do, let us take notice.]
	if the previous call frame is null or the current call frame is null:
		decide no;
	let the change direction be a debugger change direction;
	let the function change flag be false;
	let the previous line comparison call frame be an invalid call frame;
	let the current line comparison call frame be an invalid call frame;
	[Find where the change is and what it is.]
	repeat until a break:
		unless the call stack simplification flag is true and the current call frame is elided in the simplified call stack:
			now the previous line comparison call frame is the previous call frame;
			now the current line comparison call frame is the current call frame;

		if the inward link of the current call frame is null:

	if the function change flag is true:
		decide no;
	[Some commands ignore or acknowledge all changes in a given direction.]
	if the change direction is:
		-- a change inward from the reference frame:
			unless the debugger's control flow state is responding after a step:
				[As things currently stand, this shouldn't be possible.  But we want to be friendly to other extensions.]
				decide yes;
		-- a change within the reference frame:
			if the debugger's control flow state is responding after a finish:
				[As things currently stand, this shouldn't be possible.  But we want to be friendly to other extensions.]
				decide yes;
		-- a change outward from the reference frame:
			if the debugger's control flow state is responding after a finish:
				decide no;
	[In fact, sequence point next cannot ignore for any other reason.]
	if the debugger's control flow state is responding after a sequence point next:
		decide no;
	[But the other commands can ignore the breakpoint if the story hasn't moved off of the previously seen line.]
	[If we can already tell that it has, or that we don't know, then we don't ignore the breakpoint.]
	if the previous line comparison call frame is null or the current line comparison call frame is null:
		decide no;
	[When stepping, entering a non-elided frame is tantamount to moving off the previously seen line.]
	if the debugger's control flow state is responding after a step:
		let the inward call frame be the inward link of the current line comparison call frame;
		while the inward call frame is not null:
			unless the call stack simplification flag is true and the inward call frame is elided in the simplified call stack:
				decide no;
			now the inward call frame is the inward link of the inward call frame;
	[Otherwise, we do the line comparison.]
	let the previous sequence point be the last-seen sequence point of the previous line comparison call frame or the last-seen sequence point for the last-seen call stack if it is innermost;
	let the current sequence point be the last-seen sequence point of the current line comparison call frame or the last-seen sequence point before the last-seen breakpoint if it is innermost;
	let the routine record be the routine record owning the sequence point the previous sequence point;
	if the preferred debug mode for the routine record is:
		-- debugging at the I6 level:
			let the previous line number be the I6 line number for the sequence point the previous sequence point;
			let the current line number be the I6 line number for the sequence point the current sequence point;
			decide on whether or not the previous line number is the current line number;
		-- debugging at the I7 level:
			let the previous line number be the I7 line number for the sequence point the previous sequence point in the routine record the routine record;
			let the current line number be the I7 line number for the sequence point the current sequence point in the routine record the routine record;
			decide on whether or not the previous line number is the current line number;
	decide yes.

[Roughly speaking, true when the old selected frame is gone.]
To decide whether the call frame changes allow an assured advance:
	let the previous call frame be the last-seen call stack root;
	let the current call frame be the root of the debugger's current call frame;
	repeat until a break:
		if the current call frame is null:
			decide yes;
		always check that the previous call frame is not null or else fail at encountering a divider in the last-seen call stack;
		if the previous call frame is the last-seen call stack divider:
			decide no;
		unless the uninstrumented function address of the current call frame is the uninstrumented function address of the previous call frame:
			decide yes;
		unless the most recent instruction address of the current call frame is the most recent instruction address of the previous call frame:
			decide yes;
		now the current call frame is the inward link of the current call frame;
		now the previous call frame is the inward link of the previous call frame.

To begin advancing assuredly:
	now the debugger's control flow attitude is responding after an assured advance;
	if the debugger's control flow state is:
		-- responding after a sequence point next:
			let the current call frame be the leaf of the debugger's current call frame;
			disable frame-local breakpoints in the current call frame and outward, considering only elided frames;
		-- responding after a next:
			let the current call frame be the leaf of the debugger's current call frame;
			disable frame-local breakpoints in the current call frame and outward, considering only elided frames;
		-- responding after a finish:
			let the current call frame be the leaf of the debugger's current call frame;
			disable frame-local breakpoints in the current call frame and outward, considering only elided frames;
			let the previous call frame be the last-seen call stack root;
			let the current call frame be the root of the debugger's current call frame;
			while the previous call frame is not the last-seen call stack divider:
				always check that the current call frame is not null or else fail at matching a divider when finish is ignoring an interruption;
				always check that the previous call frame is not null or else fail at encountering a divider in the last-seen call stack;
				now the current call frame is the inward link of the current call frame;
				now the previous call frame is the inward link of the previous call frame;
			always check that the current call frame is not null or else fail at matching a divider when finish is ignoring an interruption;
			disable the frame-local breakpoint in the current call frame;
		-- otherwise:
			disable all frame-local breakpoints.

To decide whether we should ignore the current interruption at (B - a simple breakpoint):
	[Five cases to worry about:]
	[I. a breakpoint was forced, meaning that we must stop]
	if the breakpoint was forced:
		decide no;
	[II. a new breakpoint was encountered, meaning that we must stop]
	unless B is an invalid simple breakpoint:
		repeat with the encountered compound breakpoint running through the compound breakpoint keys of the compound breakpoint list of B:
			if the encountered compound breakpoint is enabled:
				unless the last-seen compound breakpoint list contains the key the encountered compound breakpoint:
					decide no;
	[III. an old breakpoint was encountered, but in a different frame, meaning that we must stop]
	unless B is an invalid simple breakpoint:
		repeat with the encountered compound breakpoint running through the compound breakpoint keys of the compound breakpoint list of B:
			if the encountered compound breakpoint is enabled:
				if the call frame changes warrant a distinction from the previous interruptions:
					decide no;
				break;
	[IV. we have reached a point where the control flow command is complete, meaning that we must stop]
	unless this interruption should be ignored by the control flow command:
		decide no;
	[V. we have no reason to stop, but we need to prune the old breakpoints, and we might have reason to advance with assurance]
	let the previous linked list vertex be a null linked list vertex;
	let the current linked list vertex be the last-seen compound breakpoint list converted to a linked list vertex;
	while the current linked list vertex is not null:
		let the surviving compound breakpoint be the compound breakpoint key of the current linked list vertex;
		if B is not an invalid simple breakpoint and the compound breakpoint list of B contains the key the surviving compound breakpoint:
			now the previous linked list vertex is the current linked list vertex;
			now the current linked list vertex is the link of the current linked list vertex;
		otherwise:
			let the next linked list vertex be the link of the current linked list vertex;
			if the previous linked list vertex is null:
				now the last-seen compound breakpoint list is the next linked list vertex converted to a linked list;
			otherwise:
				write the link the next linked list vertex to the previous linked list vertex;
			delete the current linked list vertex;
			now the current linked list vertex is the next linked list vertex;
	if the last-seen compound breakpoint list is empty or the call frame changes allow an assured advance:
		begin advancing assuredly;
	decide yes.

To announce breakpoints at (B - a simple breakpoint):
	let the breakpoints announced flag be false;
	if the breakpoint was forced and the debugger running flag is true:
		say "[bold type]Breakpoint triggered by source text:[roman type] [the name of the forced breakpoint][line break]";
		now the breakpoints announced flag is true;
	unless B is an invalid simple breakpoint:
		repeat with the encountered compound breakpoint running through the compound breakpoint keys of the compound breakpoint list of the B:
			if the encountered compound breakpoint is enabled:
				say "[bold type]Breakpoint [the numeric identifier of the encountered compound breakpoint]:[roman type] [the human-friendly name of the encountered compound breakpoint][line break]";
				now the breakpoints announced flag is true;
	if the breakpoints announced flag is true:
		say "[line break]".

To adjust the debugger's current call frame:
	if the call stack simplification flag is true:
		let the current call frame be the debugger's current call frame;
		while the current call frame is not null and the current call frame is elided in the simplified call stack:
			now the current call frame is the outward link of the current call frame;
		if the current call frame is null:
			now the call stack simplification flag is false;
			say "(disabling simplification because it would elide all of the present call frames)[line break]";
		otherwise:
			now the debugger's current call frame is the current call frame;
	now the debugger's current call frame number is zero.

Handling a breakpoint (this is the interactive debugger breakpoint response rule):
	now the debugger's current call frame is the innermost call frame of a reconstructed call stack;
	let the encountered simple breakpoint be the simple breakpoint representing the sequence point the last-seen sequence point before the last-seen breakpoint;
	unless we should ignore the current interruption at the encountered simple breakpoint:
		cancel any request for a debug input line;
		now the current debugger coexecution state is story interrupted;
		now the debugger prompting flag is true;
		while within the debugger window via the debugger wrapping layer:
			disable the universal breakpoint;
			disable all frame-local breakpoints;
			announce breakpoints at the encountered simple breakpoint;
			now the debugger continuing flag is false;
			adjust the debugger's current call frame;
			unless the last-seen call stack root is null:
				let the moribund call frame be the leaf of the last-seen call stack root;
				delete the moribund call frame and its ancestors;
				now the last-seen call stack root is a null call frame;
			now the last-seen call stack divider is a null call frame;
			delete the last-seen compound breakpoint list;
			now the last-seen compound breakpoint list is an empty linked list;
			if the debugger running flag is true:
				say "[the debug location synopsis]";
			request a debug command;
			while the debugger continuing flag is false:
				wait for the next foreign event using the debugger wrapping layer;
			now the debugger's control flow attitude is responding after an assured advance;
			if the encountered simple breakpoint is not an invalid simple breakpoint:
				repeat with the encountered compound breakpoint running through the compound breakpoint keys of the compound breakpoint list of the encountered simple breakpoint:
					if the encountered compound breakpoint is enabled:
						push the key the encountered compound breakpoint onto the last-seen compound breakpoint list;
						now the debugger's control flow attitude is responding after a cautious advance;
			if the debugger's control flow attitude is responding after a cautious advance:
				enable frame-local breakpoints in the debugger's current call frame and outward;
			now the last-seen call stack root is the root of the debugger's current call frame;
			now the last-seen call stack divider is the debugger's current call frame;
			now the last-seen sequence point for the last-seen call stack is the last-seen sequence point before the last-seen breakpoint;
		now the current debugger coexecution state is story unpaused.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Chapter: Synopsis

Interactive Debugger shows us what is happening ``inside'' of an Inform 7 story,
making it easier for us figure out why the latter behaves the way it does.  With
the extension we can (1) pause execution when certain conditions hold, resuming
it later, and (2) inspect the state of the story while it is paused.  Its
interface should be familiar to authors who have experience using gdb.

Details are in README.pdf, which accompanies the distribution of the extension,
and is also available for download from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/.

Chapter: Requirements, Limitations, and Bugs

This version was tested with Inform 6G60.  It will probably function on newer
versions, and it may function under slightly older versions, though there is no
guarantee.

Interactive Debugger is subject to the caveats for the Glulx Runtime
Instrumentation Framework; see the requirements chapter in its documentation for
the technical details.

Section: Regarding bugs

If you encounter a bug, check first on the project website
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/i7grip/) to see whether a newer version of
this extension is available.  If, even using the latest version, the fault
remains, please file a bug report: On the website, choose "Support" from the
toolbar and follow the link in the box titled "Best Way to Get Help".

I will try to respond quickly, at least with an estimate of when the bug might
be fixed, though sometimes I am away from the internet for a week or two at a
time.

Chapter: Acknowledgements

  always up-to-date specifications,

- Jacqueline Lott, David Welbourn, and all of the other attendees for Club
  Floyd, my first connection to the interactive fiction community,

- Jesse McGrew and Emily Short for getting me involved with Inform 7,

Example: * Tournament - The First Tutorial Story

README.pdf, which should have come with the extension, contains two debugger
tutorials.  The following source text is the story used in the first one.

	*: "Tournament" by Brady Garvin.
	
	Include Interactive Debugger by Brady Garvin.
	The name of the symbolic link to the debug information file is "...".
	The name of the symbolic link to the intermediate I6 file is "...".
	The name of the symbolic link to the debugging log file is "...".
	
	The Lists are a Room.
	A mark is a kind of thing.
	Here is a mark called a target; here is a mark called a willow wand.
	The player is a man called Locksley.
	An arrow is a kind of thing.
	The player carries a longbow and three arrows.
	
	Understand the command "shoot" as "attack".
	
	Check attacking (this is the check archery rule):
		if the noun is not a mark:
			abide by the block attacking rule;
		if the player does not carry the longbow:
			say "You lack a bow.";
			stop the action;
		if the player does not carry an arrow:
			say "You lack an arrow.";
			stop the action.
	
	The check archery rule is listed instead of the block attacking rule in the check attacking rulebook.
	
	To hit (T - a mark) with (A - an arrow):
		if an arrow (called the previous shot) is part of T:
			now A is part of the previous shot;
		otherwise:
			now A is part of T.
	
	To hit (T - the willow wand) with (A - an arrow):
		remove the willow wand from play;
		move A to the location of T.
	
	Carry out attacking:
		if the player carries an arrow (called the missile):
			hit the noun with the missile.
	
	Report attacking:
		say "Your arrow buries itself in [the noun]."
	
	Report attacking the willow wand:
		say "Your arrow splits the rod.";
		stop.

Example: ** Monochrome - The Second Tutorial Story

README.pdf, which should have come with the extension, contains two debugger
tutorials.  The following source text is the story used in the second one.

	*: "Monochrome" by Brady Garvin.
	
	Include Interactive Debugger by Brady Garvin.
	The name of the symbolic link to the debug information file is "...".
	The name of the symbolic link to the intermediate I6 file is "...".
	The name of the symbolic link to the debugging log file is "...".
	
	Monochromatic is a truth state that varies.  Monochromatic is false.
	
	Drawing Room is a room.
	The table is a supporter in the drawing room.  The description is "A low coffee table, mahogany, to guess from the [if monochromatic is true]dark gray[otherwise]reddish-brown[end if] color."
	The bowl is a container on the table.  The description is "Ceramic[if monochromatic is true] and glaringly white[otherwise], in a stunning lemon yellow[end if]."
	The fruit is an edible thing in the bowl.  The indefinite article is "some".  The description is "[if monochromatic is true]Three silvery apples[otherwise]Two red apples, a green one,[end if] and a [if monochromatic is true]charcoal [end if]pear."
	
	The player carries a whiteboard.  The whiteboard has some indexed text called the image.  The image of the whiteboard is "".  The description of the whiteboard is "[if the image of the whiteboard is empty]It's blank.[otherwise]It shows [the image of the whiteboard][end if]".
	
	Drawing is an action applying to one thing.
	Understand "draw [something]" as drawing.
	Carry out drawing:
		now the image of the whiteboard is the description of the noun in lower case.
	Report drawing:
		say "You capture the essence of [the noun] perfectly."
	
	Xyzzying is an action applying to nothing.
	Understand "xyzzy" as xyzzying.
	Carry out xyzzying:
		now monochromatic is whether or not monochromatic is false.
	Report xyzzying:
		say "Something has changed."
